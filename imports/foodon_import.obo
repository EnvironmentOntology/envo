comment: The FoodOn product type class is provided as a food product category tree under which new food product categories and food products themselves can be placed.  This tree has upper level categories inspired from other product type schemes like the US Code of Federal Regulations.  However it has a much greater depth to it than the other product type schemes in an effort to group related products together.  The basis of this tree was inherited from the environment ontology (ENVO).

comment: "While fermentation is also referred to in the production of brewed teas, this is inaccurate. Some herbal teas on the market today include probiotic cultures alongside tea leaves to maintain gut health but the tea itself hasn't been fermented. Most dried teas however don't use live cultures at all during production. Instead, harvested tea leaves undergo a natural chemical process known as oxidation, which also changes the color, flavor and level of health benefits in the resulting brew."

Plants in this genus are commonly referred to as yam bean, although the term \"yam bean\" can be another name for jícama.\n\nIn contrast to the root, the remainder of the jícama plant is very poisonous; the seeds contain the toxin rotenone, which is used to poison insects and fish.\n\nFAO: The yam bean is a legume but unlike its close relatives the soybean and other beans, the yam bean is cultivated for its large, tuberous roots."

It was first adopted by the 18th Session of the Codex Alimentarius Commission, (1989).\n\nThe Codex Classification includes food commodities and animal feedstuffs for which Codex maximum residue limits will not necessarily be established. The Classification is intended to be as complete a listing of food commodities in trade as possible, classified into groups on the basis of the commodity's similar potential for pesticide residues.\n\nThe Classification may also be appropriate for other purposes such as setting maximum levels for other types of residues or for other contaminants in food. The Codex Classification should be consulted in order to obtain a precise description of the food or animal feed commodities and, especially, in cases where Codex maximum residue limits have been set for groups of food and groups of animal feedstuffs. The Codex Classification is intended to promote harmonization of the terms used to describe commodities which are subject to maximum residue limits and of the approach to grouping commodities with similar potential for residue for which a common group maximum residue limit can be set."

comment: LanguaL curation note: Used when such an ingredient is added for the purpose of imparting flavor or taste. Processes such as salting and smoking are also used for preservation. If one of these is used as the primary preservation method, the appropriate factor value from *J. PRESERVATION METHOD* (e.g., *preservation by SALTING*) should also be applied.

name: food component addition process
comment: LanguaL curation note: A food product is characterized by its main ingredient (food source and part); the addition of secondary ingredients is considered a treatment applied to the product. Secondary ingredients are indexed according to rules that are based on the order of predominance by weight (not counting water) as seen from the label statement, formulation or recipe and/or from the amount of the ingredient as percentage of total product weight. The general rule is:  an ingredient is always indexed if it is the second ingredient in order of predominance, if it is used as a filling, or if it is part of the product name(e.g., raisin bread). Specific rules are given in the scope note for the individual ingredient added; these rules specify more exhaustive indexing. For example, *MUSHROOM ADDED* is indexed regardless of ingredient position. another specific rule is given in the scope note for *SALTED*:  Use if the level of salt is more than 4%. Such a rule is used only when the percentage level can be inferred from the list of ingredients.
