comment: The FoodOn "food product" class is provided as a branch under which new food product categories and food products themselves can be placed. Here classes are provided to differentiate a food product by its food composition, processing and/or consumption characteristics. This avoids brand name products but it may include generic food dish categories. It has a much greater depth and polyhierarchy than other agency product type schemes have in an effort to group related products together.  The upper level basis of this tree originated in the environment ontology (ENVO) and from the US Code of Federal Regulations.

Some herbal teas on the market today include probiotic cultures alongside tea leaves to maintain gut health but the tea itself hasn't been fermented. Most dried teas however don't use live cultures at all during production. Instead, harvested tea leaves undergo a natural chemical process known as oxidation, which also changes the color, flavor and level of health benefits in the resulting brew."

Jícama is a species in the genus Pachyrhizus in the bean family (Fabaceae). Plants in this genus are commonly referred to as yam bean, although the term \"yam bean\" can be another name for jícama.\n\nIn contrast to the root, the remainder of the jícama plant is very poisonous; the seeds contain the toxin rotenone, which is used to poison insects and fish.\n\nFAO: The yam bean is a legume but unlike its close relatives the soybean and other beans, the yam bean is cultivated for its large, tuberous roots."

It was first adopted by the 18th Session of the Codex Alimentarius Commission, (1989).\n\nThe Codex Classification includes food commodities and animal feedstuffs for which Codex maximum residue limits will not necessarily be established. The Classification is intended to be as complete a listing of food commodities in trade as possible, classified into groups on the basis of the commodity's similar potential for pesticide residues.\n\nThe Classification may also be appropriate for other purposes such as setting maximum levels for other types of residues or for other contaminants in food. The Codex Classification should be consulted in order to obtain a precise description of the food or animal feed commodities and, especially, in cases where Codex maximum residue limits have been set for groups of food and groups of animal feedstuffs. The Codex Classification is intended to promote harmonization of the terms used to describe commodities which are subject to maximum residue limits and of the approach to grouping commodities with similar potential for residue for which a common group maximum residue limit can be set."

For the sake of convenience in this guide such crops are classified under Type 2 Vegetables.\nExposure to pesticides is dependent on the particular part of the plant used for food and the growing practices.\nVegetables may be consumed in whole or in part and in the form of fresh, dried or processed foods."

The extract, concentrate or isolate is indexed in preference to the anatomic part from which it is derived.

On the other hand, fruit and vegetable juices can be indexed under *FRUIT JUICE OR NECTAR* or *VEGETABLE JUICE* (A. PRODUCT TYPE); therefore the anatomic part of the plant should be indexed." []
