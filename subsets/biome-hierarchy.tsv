The natural chemical activity of salty (or brackish) water and the tendency of algae to bloom in the shallow unshaded water also allow for great biodiversity.

ENVO:01000035	oceanic epipelagic zone biome	ENVO:01000033	oceanic pelagic zone biome			The oceanic epipelagic zone biome comprises regions of the marine water column that occur offshore, beyond a continental shelf. This biome extends from the surface of the ocean to a depth of ca. 200-250m.

This zone typically extends 100 m above the seafloor, but may reach upto1000 m during benthic storms.
