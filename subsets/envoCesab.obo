comment: This was formerly represented as a water body, which would not be valid during dry periods. This class more properly refers to the container of the water body, thusfar always some depression, which periodically contains a water body.

comment: Everything under this parent must be a mass noun. All subclasses are to be understood as being composed primarily of the named entity, rather than restricted to that entity. For example, "ENVO:water" is to be understood as "environmental material composed primarly of some CHEBI:water". This class is currently being aligned to the Basic Formal Ontology. Following this alignment, its definition and the definitions of its subclasses will be revised.

def: "A quality which inheres in a astronomical body or astronomical body part by virtue of the variation in its material composition, participation in geological processes, and the variation in is land- and hydroforms." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodiversity]
comment: Materials which are usually assessed when appraising geodiversity include minerals, rocks, sediments, fossils, soils and water. Landforms factored into geodiversity metrics typically include folds, faults, and other expressions of morphology or relations between units of earth material. Natural processes that are included in measures of geodiversity are those which either maintain or change materials or geoforms, including tectonics, sediment transport, and pedogenesis. Geodiversity does not usually factor in anthropogenic entities. {xref=""}

def: "A solid astronomical body part which has been formed from and is composed primarily of the matter of that astronomical body." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landform]
comment: Landforms may be natural or anthropogenic. This term has often has loose usage when referencing entities which are either subterranean or submerged below water bodies. In some cases, oceans themselves are considered landforms. Here, we have provided subclasses to resolve this ambiguity, but place oceans and other water bodies elsewhere.In later revisions, this hiearchy is likely to be reordered based on the formation processes of the entities within it.
