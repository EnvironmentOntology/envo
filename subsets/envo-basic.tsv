Its long axis is parallel with the movement of the ice, with the blunter end facing into the glacial movement. Drumlins are sometimes compared to kames, but their formation is distinctively different. A drumlin is not originally shaped by meltwater, but by the ice itself and has a quite regular shape. It occurs in fine grained material, such as clay or shale, not in sands and gravels. And drumlins usually have concentric layers of material, as the ice successively plasters new layers in its movement.

A salt pan is formed where water pools. A saline pan would be a lake or a pond if it were located in a climate where the rate of water evaporation were not faster than the rate of water precipitation, i.e., if it were not in a desert. If the water is unable to drain into the ground, it remains on the surface until it evaporates, leaving behind whatever minerals were dissolved. Over thousands of years, the minerals (usually salts) accumulate on the surface.

A spit is a type of bar or beach that develops where a re-entrant occurs, such as at a cove, bay, ria, or river mouth. Spits are formed by the movement of sediment (typically sand) along a shore by a process known as longshore drift. Where the direction of the shore turns inland (reenters) the longshore current spreads out or dissipates. No longer able to carry the full load, much of the sediment is dropped. This causes a bar to build out from the shore, eventually becoming a spit.

Glacial outwash is generated when sediment laden streams of meltwater flow away from the glacier and are deposited to form broad outwash plains called sandurs. When the ice blocks melt, holes are left in the sandur.
ENVO:00000312	sandur	ENVO:00000086	plain	outwash plain		The plain formed by the large amounts of silt and sediment, picked up as a glacier erodes the underlying rocks as it moves slowly downhill, and at the snout of the glacier, meltwater can carry this sediment away from the glacier and deposit it on a broad plain. The material in the outwash plain is often size-sorted by the water runoff of the melting glacier with the finest materials, like silt, being the most distantly re-deposited, whereas larger boulders are the closest to the original terminus of the glacier.

TARGET DEFINITION: A large area of brine on the ocean basin near cold seep vents which release methane into the water. These pools are concentrations of water having an extremely high salinity as compared to the surrounding ocean, caused by the motion of large salt deposits through salt tectonics.
--------------------
SOURCE DEFINITION: Marine brine pools are large areas of brine on the ocean basin. These pools are bodies of water that have a salinity three to five times greater than the surrounding ocean. For deep-sea brine pools the source of the salt is the dissolution of large salt deposits through salt tectonics. The brine often contains high concentrations of methane, providing energy to chemosynthetic animals that live near the pool."

Explosive eruptions from a vent where the magma is interacting with groundwater or the sea (as in an eruption off the coast) produce steam and are called phreatic. The interaction between the magma, expanding steam, and volcanic gases results in the ejection of mostly small particles called ash. Fallen ash has the consistency of flour. The unconsolidated ash forms an ash cone which becomes a tuff cone or tuff ring once the ash consolidates.
ENVO:00000400	cinder cone	ENVO:00000398|RO:0002473 some (ENVO:01000660 and ENVO:01000662 and ENVO:01000663)	 some (tephra and scoria and pumice)|volcanic cone	mount		A cone built almost entirely of loose volcanic fragments called cinders (pumice, pyroclastics, or tephra). They are built from particles and blobs of congealed lava ejected from a single vent. As the gas-charged lava is blown violently into the air, it breaks into small fragments that solidify and fall as cinders around the vent to form a circular or oval cone. Most cinder cones have a bowl-shaped crater at the summit.
ENVO:00000401	spatter cone	ENVO:00000398	volcanic cone			A volcanic cone formed of molten lava ejected from a vent somewhat like taffy.

ENVO:00000452	ribbon lake	ENVO:00000020	lake			A lake that is long, narrow, and finger-shaped, usually found in a glacial trough. Its formation begins when a glacier moves over an area containing alternate bands of hard and soft bedrock. The sharp-edged boulders carried at the bottom of the glacier erode the softer rock more quickly by abrasion, thus creating a hollow called a rock basin. On either side of the rock basin, the more resistant rock is eroded less and these outcrops of harder rock are known as rock bars, which act as dams between which rainwater may accumulate after the retreat of the ice age, filling up the rock basin and creating a ribbon lake. A ribbon lake may also form behind a terminal or recessional moraine, both of which also act as dams, enabling water to accumulate behind them. A ribbon lake may also occur if a tributary glacier joins a main glacier. The increase in power can create a trough, which is filled with water from a river/meltwater to create a ribbon lake.
ENVO:00000453	liman	ENVO:01000617	lentic water body			A lake or estuary that is formed at the mouth of a river where flow is blocked by a bar of sediments.

ENVO:00000461	pseudocrater	ENVO:00000514	crater	rootless vent		A volcanic landform which resembles a true volcanic crater, but differs in that it is not an actual vent from which lava has erupted. A pseudocrater is characterised by the absence of any magma conduit which connects below the surface of the earth. Pseudocraters are formed by steam explosions as flowing hot lava crosses over a wet surface, such as a swamp, a lake, or a pond. The explosive gases break through the lava surface in a manner similar to a phreatic eruption, and the tephra builds up crater-like forms which can appear very similar to real volcanic craters.
ENVO:00000462	polygenetic volcanic field	ENVO:00000354	volcanic field			A volcanic field of scattered volcanic vents. These volcanic fields, containing numerous polygenetic volcanoes, are noted for having more than one eruptive event from the same vent(s), rather than the more common monogenetic volcanic field. Polygenetic volcanic fields generally occur where there is a high-level magma chamber. These volcanic fields may show lithological discontinuities due to major changes in magma chemistry, volcanotectonic events, or long erosional intervals, and may last >10 million year period.

Phaeozems may or may not have secondary carbonates but have a high base saturation in the upper metre of the soil.
ENVO:00002250	plinthosol	ENVO:00001998	soil			Plinthosols are soils with plinthite, petroplinthite or pisoliths. Plinthite is an Fe-rich (in some cases also Mn-rich), humus-poor mixture of kaolinitic clay (and other products of strong weathering such as gibbsite) with quartz and other constituents that changes irreversibly to a layer with hard nodules, a hardpan or irregular aggregates on exposure to repeated wetting and drying. Petroplinthite is a continuous, fractured or broken sheet of connected, strongly cemented to indurated nodules or mottles. Pisoliths are discrete strongly cemented to indurated nodules. Both petroplinthite and pisoliths develop from plinthite by hardening.
ENVO:00002251	planosol	ENVO:00001998	soil			Planosols are soils with a light-coloured, surface horizon that shows signs of periodic water stagnation and abruptly overlies a dense, slowly permeable subsoil with significantly more clay than the surface horizon.
ENVO:00002252	solonchak	ENVO:00001998	soil			Solonchaks are soils that have a high concentration of soluble salts at some time in the year. Solonchaks are largely confined to the arid and semi-arid climate zones and to coastal regions in all climates.
ENVO:00002253	umbrisol	ENVO:00001998	soil			Umbrisols are soils in which organic matter has accumulated within the mineral surface soil (in most cases with low base saturation) to the extent that it significantly affects the behaviour and utilization of the soil.
ENVO:00002254	vertisol	ENVO:00001998	soil			A soil in which there is a high content of expansive clay known as montmorillonite that forms deep cracks in drier seasons or years. Alternate shrinking and swelling causes self-mulching, where the soil material consistently mixes itself, causing vertisols to have an extremely deep A horizon and no B horizon.
ENVO:00002255	solonetz	ENVO:00001998	soil			Solonetz are soils with a dense, strongly structured, clayey subsurface horizon that has a high proportion of adsorbed Na and/or Mg ions. Solonetz that contain free soda (Na2CO3) are strongly alkaline (field pH > 8.5).
ENVO:00002256	regosol	ENVO:00001998	soil			Regosols form a taxonomic remnant group containing all soils that could not be accommodated in any of the other RSGs. In practice, Regosols are very weakly developed mineral soils in unconsolidated materials that do not have a mollic or umbric horizon, are not very shallow or very rich in gravels (Leptosols), sandy (Arenosols) or with fluvic materials (Fluvisols). Regosols are extensive in eroding lands, particularly in arid and semi-arid areas and in mountainous terrain.
ENVO:00002257	podzol	ENVO:00001998	soil	podosolic soil|podsol		Podzols are soils with a typically ash-grey upper subsurface horizon, bleached by loss of organic matter and iron oxides, on top of a dark accumulation horizon with brown, reddish or black illuviated humus and/or reddish Fe compounds.

TARGET DEFINITION: An oceanographic feature that involves wind-driven motion of dense, cooler, and usually nutrient-rich water towards the ocean surface, replacing the warmer, usually nutrient-deplete surface water.
--------------------
SOURCE DEFINITION: A marine upwelling is a net flow of marine water to the surface of the water column from deeper regions. This is often a result of surface water displacement off continental coasts by wind action. Localised upwellings may also occur along divergent fronts around eddies and along some of the major oceanographic features. Deeper waters often have higher nutrient content; consequently blooms of primary producers, such as planktonic algae, are generally observed around upwelling zones."

ENVO:01000035	oceanic epipelagic zone biome	ENVO:01000033	oceanic pelagic zone biome			The oceanic epipelagic zone biome comprises regions of the marine water column that occur offshore, beyond a continental shelf. This biome extends from the surface of the ocean to a depth of ca. 200-250m. Throughout the zone the light field tends to be asymmetrical vertically, so that the direction and elevation of the sun can still be detected. The oceanic epipelagic zone biome encompasses the euphotic zone and, where and when it occurs, the seasonal thermocline.
ENVO:01000036	oceanic mesopelagic zone biome	ENVO:01000033	oceanic pelagic zone biome			The oceanic mesopelagic zone biome comprises regions of the marine water column that occur offshore, beyond a continental shelf. This biome extends through the water column from approximately 200-1000 m depth - the maximal depth of light penetration in all but the clearest oligotrophic ocean regions.

This condition is generally found in areas that have restricted water exchange. In most cases, oxygen is prevented from reaching the deeper levels by a physical barrier (sill) as well as by a pronounced density stratification. Anoxic conditions will occur if the rate of oxidation of organic matter by bacteria is greater than the supply of dissolved oxygen.
ENVO:01000067	marine current	ENVO:01001607|RO:0002473 some ENVO:00002149	 some sea water|water current		envoPolar	A water current which is maintained by a continuous, directed movement of marine water, generated by forces caused by breaking waves, wind, Coriolis force, temperature and salinity differences, and tides caused by the gravitational pull of astronomical bodies.

The sense of rotation of these currents may either be cyclonic or anticyclonic. Ocean eddies are also usually made of water masses that are different to those outside of the eddy. Marine mesoscale eddies are between about 10 and 500 km in diameter, and persist for periods of days to months. They may be formed when an ocean current develops an instability. This instability grows, causing the current to meander, and eventually an eddy is pinched off from the meander.

https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2306597	Suni			Jalca		"""Suni, or Jalca, is one of the eight Natural Regions of Peru. It is located in the Andes at an altitude between 3,500 and 4,000 metres above sea level. Suni has a dry and cold weather and there are many glacial valleys. The flora includes gramineous plants and shrubs such as the taya-taya (Caesalpinia spinosa), the quishuar (Buddleja coriacea), and the cantuta (Cantua buxifolia) which was considered sacred by the Incas. Even though it is hard for plants to grow because of the weather, people are able to cultivate such crops as quinoa, qañiwa, broad beans and ulluku (Ullucus tuberosus). The main fauna is the guinea pig and, among numerous other highland birds, the Chiguanco thrush."""
