def: "An accumulation of water of varying size." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_of_water]
comment: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ The term body of water most often refers to large accumulations of water, such as oceans, seas, and lakes, but it includes smaller pools of water such as ponds, wetlands, or more rarely, puddles. A body of water does not have to be still or contained; Rivers, streams, canals, and other geographical features where water moves from one place to another are also considered bodies of water.

Tree cover alone is not enough to distinguish between forests and plantations. The international definition proposed by the 2010 FAO Forestry Resource Assessment: "land spanning more than 0.5 ha with trees higher than 5 metres and canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ . It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use." - FAO.  2010. Global forest resources assessment 2010, Main report, FAO Forestry Paper 163. Rome.

They are typically composed of sand, although could be of any granular matter that the moving water has access to and is capable of shifting around (for example, soil, silt, gravel, cobble, shingle, or even boulders). The grain size of the material comprising a bar is related: to the size of the waves or the strength of the currents moving the material, but the availability of material to be worked by waves and currents is also important."

Where the direction of the shore turns inland (reenters) the longshore current spreads out or dissipates. No longer able to carry the full load, much of the sediment is dropped.

In fine grained soils, capillary action can cause the pores of the soil to be fully saturated above the water table at a pressure less than atmospheric. In such soils, therefore, the unsaturated zone is the upper section of the vadose zone and not identical to it.

name: ribbon lake
def: "A lake that is long, narrow, and finger-shaped, usually found in a glacial trough. Its formation begins when a glacier moves over an area containing alternate bands of hard and soft bedrock. The sharp-edged boulders carried at the bottom of the glacier erode the softer rock more quickly by abrasion, thus creating a hollow called a rock basin. On either side of the rock basin, the more resistant rock is eroded less and these outcrops of harder rock are known as rock bars, which act as dams between which rainwater may accumulate after the retreat of the ice age, filling up the rock basin and creating a ribbon lake. A ribbon lake may also form behind a terminal or recessional moraine, both of which also act as dams, enabling water to accumulate behind them. A ribbon lake may also occur if a tributary glacier joins a main glacier. The increase in power can create a trough, which is filled with water from a river/meltwater to create a ribbon lake."

def: "A low oval elevation in areas with permafrost, frequently peat bogs, where a perennial ice lens has developed within the soil. A palsa consists, similarly to a pingo, of an ice core and overlying soil materials, in case of a palsa usually boggy soil. Palsas are characteristically found in areas with discontinuous permafrost and in such areas bay be the only reliable surface evidence of permafrost. A palsa needs large quantities of water for the formation of its ice core (i.e. ice lens), which is why they frequently emerge from and are bound by boggy soils, which can store enormous quantities of water in their pores. Palsas develop particularly in moorlands and are therefore also named palsamoors." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palsa]

def: "Soil is an environmental material which is primarily composed of minerals, varying proportions of sand, silt, and clay, organic material such as humus, gases, liquids, and a broad range of resident micro- and macroorganisms." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil]
comment: 'In engineering terms, soil is referred to as regolith, or loose rock material that lies above the 'solid geology'. Soil is commonly referred to as "earth" or "dirt"; technically, the term "dirt" should be restricted to displaced soil.' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil\n\n" The upper limit of soil is the boundary between soil and air, shallow water, live plants, or plant materials that have not begun to decompose. Areas are not considered to have soil if the surface is permanently covered by water too deep (typically more than 2.5 meters) for the growth of rooted plants.\n\nThe lower boundary that separates soil from the nonsoil underneath is most difficult to define. Soil consists of horizons near the Earth's surface that, in contrast to the underlying parent material, have been altered by the interactions of climate, relief, and living organisms over time.

comment: 'Terminology differs between countries. For example, in the United States, the entire dairy farm is commonly called a "dairy." The building or farm area where milk is harvested from the cow is often called a "milking parlor" or "parlor." The farm area where milk is stored in bulk tanks is known as the farm's "milk house." Milk is then hauled (usually by truck) to a "dairy plant," also referred to as a "dairy", where raw milk is further processed and prepared for commercial sale of dairy products. In New Zealand, farm areas for milk harvesting are also called "milking parlours", and are historically known as "milking sheds."' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy

comment: This class is distinct from a geometric surface, which is two-dimensional. The idea of "uppermost" may be problematic. Further, the definition of layer (the superclass of surface in rev 133) references surface. This may be another issue. Perhaps this can be made into an inferred class using 'bounding layer of' some material entity, note that 'bounding layer' implies containment, which may not be valid here.

def: "MERGED DEFINITION:\nTARGET DEFINITION: An oceanographic feature that involves wind-driven motion of dense, cooler, and usually nutrient-rich water towards the ocean surface, replacing the warmer, usually nutrient-deplete surface water.\n--------------------\nSOURCE DEFINITION: A marine upwelling is a net flow of marine water to the surface of the water column from deeper regions. This is often a result of surface water displacement off continental coasts by wind action. Localised upwellings may also occur along divergent fronts around eddies and along some of the major oceanographic features. Deeper waters often have higher nutrient content; consequently blooms of primary producers, such as planktonic algae, are generally observed around upwelling zones."

In actuality, silt is chemically distinct from clay, and unlike clay, grains of silt are approximately the same size in all dimensions; furthermore, their size ranges overlap. Clays are formed from thin plate-shaped particles held together by electrostatic forces, so present a cohesion. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture Soil Texture Classification system, the sand-silt distinction is made at the 0.05 mm particle size. The USDA system has been adopted by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). In the Unified Soil Classification System (USCS) and the AASHTO Soil Classification system, the sand-silt distinction is made at the 0.075 mm particle size (i.e., material passing the #200 sieve). Silts and clays are distinguished mechanically by their plasticity.

Marine mesoscale eddies are between about 10 and 500 km in diameter, and persist for periods of days to months. They may be formed when an ocean current develops an instability.

def: "A marine current bordered by the surface of the water column and the permanent thermocline, where it occurs. Surface currents are mostly wind driven and mostly limited to the top 400 m of the water column. Ocean currents are driven by the circulation of wind above surface waters. Frictional stress at the interface between the ocean and the wind causes the water to move in the direction of the wind. Large ocean currents are a response of the atmosphere and ocean to the flow of energy from the tropics to polar regions. In some cases, currents are transient features and affect only a small area. Other ocean currents are essentially permanent and extend over large horizontal distances."

[]
comment: As with most other climatic zones and conditions, multiple classification schemes have somehat different definitions and criteria. To quote from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ "Several methods have been used to define the subtropical climate. In the Trewartha climate classification, a subtropical region should have at least eight months with a mean temperature of 10 C (50.0 F) or above. German climatologists Carl Troll and Karlheinz Paffen defined Warm temperate zones as plain and hilly lands having an average temperature of the coldest month between 2 C (35.6 F) and 13 C (55.4 F) in the Northern Hemisphere and between 6 C (42.8 F) and 13 C (55.4 F) in the Southern Hemisphere, excluding oceanic and continental climates. According to the Troll-Paffen climate classification, there generally exists one large subtropical zone named the warm-temperate subtropical zone,[4] which is subdivided into seven smaller areas.[5]\n\nAccording to the E. Neef climate classification, the subtropical zone is divided into two parts: Rainy winters of the west sides and Eastern subtropical climate.[6] According to the Wilhelm Lauer & Peter Frankenberg climate classification, the subtropical zone is divided into three parts: high-continental, continental, and maritime.[7] According to the Siegmund/Frankenberg climate classification, subtropical is one of six climate zones in the world.[8]"

def: "Mafic lava is lava which, relative to other lava types other than ultramafic lava, has a  high ferromagnesian content and low aluminium and silica content, with silca making up between 45 and 52 percent of its weight. Mafic lava generally erupts at temperatures in excess of 950 degrees Celsius. The high temperature and low polymerisation in mafic lava favors low viscosity and chemical diffusion, promoting the formation of large, well-formed phenocrysts."

comment: Unlike biomes, ecoregions are geographically defined entities. ENVO's sister project, GAZ, contains terms for instances of ecoregions (e.g. Beringia lowland tundra). Requests for new terms should be directed to GAZ. ENVO will only contain this top-level class. The class' definition is preliminary and will be aligned to BFO.

def: "Ecozones delineate large areas of a planetary surface within which organisms have been evolving in relative isolation over long periods of time, separated from one another by geographic features, such as oceans, broad deserts, or high mountain ranges, that constitute barriers to migration." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ecozone]
comment: ENVO contains this top-level class, but all instances will be in GAZ. The definition is preliminary and will be aligned to BFO.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/  Ecozones correspond to the floristic kingdoms of botany or zoogeographic regions of zoology. Ecozones are characterized by the evolutionary history of the organisms they contain. They are distinct from biomes, also known as major habitat types, which are divisions of the Earth's surface based on life form, or the adaptation of plants and animals to climatic, soil, and other conditions. Biomes are characterized by similar climax vegetation. Each ecozone may include a number of different biomes. A tropical moist broadleaf forest in Central America, for example, may be similar to one in New Guinea in its vegetation type and structure, climate, soils, etc., but these forests are inhabited by plants and animals with very different evolutionary histories.

A cold desert climate is typically found in temperate zones, almost always in the rain shadow of high mountains which restrict precipitation from the westerly winds, or in the case of Central Asia, from the monsoon. The Gobi desert in Mongolia is a classic example of a region with a cold desert climate. Though hot in summer, it shares the very cold winters of the rest of Central Asia. The Kyzyl Kum and Taklamakan deserts of Central Asia and the drier portions of the Great Basin Desert of the western United States are other major examples of BWk climates.

name: wet meadow
def: "A wet meadow is a type of wetland with soils that are saturated with water for part or all of the growing season." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_meadow]
comment: Debate exists whether a wet meadow is a type of marsh or a completely separate type of wetland. Wet prairies and wet savannas are hydrologically similar. Wet meadows may occur because of restricted drainage or the receipt of large amounts of water from rain or melted snow. They may also occur in riparian zones and around the shores of large lakes. Unlike a marsh or swamp, a wet meadow does not have standing water present except for brief to moderate periods during the growing season. Instead, the ground in a wet meadow fluctuates between brief periods of inundation and longer periods of saturation. Wet meadows often have large numbers of wetland plant species, which frequently survive as buried seeds during dry periods, and then regenerate after flooding. Wet meadows therefore do not usually support aquatic life such as fish. They typically have a high diversity of plant species, and may attract large numbers of birds, small mammals and insects including butterflies. {xref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_meadow"}

Paraffin is obtained from the fractional distillation of petroleum between 150 and 275 degrees Celsius, resulting in a mixture with a density of 0.780.81 grams per cubic centimetre. It is miscible in petroleum solvents but immiscible in water. Regardless of crude oil source or processing history, kerosene's major components are branched and straight chain alkanes and naphthenes (cycloalkanes), which normally account for at least 70% by volume. Aromatic hydrocarbons in this boiling range, such as alkylbenzenes (single ring) and alkylnaphthalenes (double ring), do not normally exceed 25% by volume of kerosene streams. Olefins are usually not present at more than 5% by volume." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerosene]

def: "A piece of furniture is a movable object intended to support various human activities such as seating (e.g., chairs, stools and sofas) and sleeping (e.g., beds)." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furniture]
comment: The assumption is that furniture is manufactured, which is arguable. Further, according to Black's Law Dictionary (http://thelawdictionary.org/furniture/) many classes can be subclasses of 'piece of furntiure': "This term includes that which furnishes, or with which anything is furnished or supplied; whatever must be supplied to a house, a room, or the like, to make it habitable, convenient, or agreeable; goods, vessels, utensils, and other appendages necessary or convenient for housekeeping; whatever is added to the interior of a house or apartment, for use or convenience. Bell v. Holding, 27 Ind. 173.The term furniture? embraces everything about the house that has been usually enjoyed there, including plate, linen, china, and pictures. 1 Endicott v. Endicott, 41N. J. Eq. 96, 3 Atl. 157.The word furniture? made use of in the disposition of the law. or in the conventions or acts of persons, comprehends only such furniture as is intended for use and ornament of apartments, but not libraries which happen to be there, nor plate. Civ.Code La. art. 477." However, this would eventually be absurd and limit other groupings. Perhaps some sort of 'furnishing' BFO:function would be a better way to handle this.

During its 2006 meeting, the IAU reclassified minor planets and comets into dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies (SSSB). Objects are called dwarf planets if their self-gravity is sufficient to achieve hydrostatic equilibrium and form an ellipsoidal shape. All other minor planets and comets are called small Solar System bodies. The IAU stated that the term minor planet may still be used, but the term small Solar System body will be preferred. However, for purposes of numbering and naming, the traditional distinction between minor planet and comet is still used." {xref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_planet"}

comment: In 1988, the FAO introduced a definition of aquaculture which reduces its confusion with capture fisheries: Aquaculture is the farming of aquatic organisms, including fish, molluscs, crustaceans and aquatic plants. Farming implies some form of intervention in the rearing process to enhance production, such as regular stocking, feeding, protection from predators, etc. Farming also implies individual or corporate ownership of the stock being cultivated. For statistical purposes, aquatic organisms which are harvested by an individual or corporate body which has owned them throughout their rearing period contribute to aquaculture, while aquatic organisms which are exploitable by the public as a common property resources, with or without appropriate licences, are the harvest of fisheries.

comment: While the usage of the term is still debated, the general idea is that time crystals (which have been made using ytterbium ions and defect-bearing diamonds) break temporal symmetry analogously to how mineral crystal break spatial symmetry. While spatial crystals are inhomogeneous in space (vs a gas, which is distributed evenly) due to the ordering of their atoms, the properties of atoms in a time crystal are inhomogeneous in the time dimension.

Though called \"red\" because it sometimes takes the color of oxidized iron minerals, it is usually brownish in color. Its ultimate origin is uncertain, but red clay seems to be mostly derived from distant rivers, and windblown dust.

def: "A process during which the intesity of stellar radiation received by a planet's surface varies in a cyclical regime due to the planet's orbital motion around the barycentre of a planetary system and/or the tilt of its rotational axis relative to its orbital plane." []
comment: The seasons that are generated by this process are divisions of time between warm (maximal radiation exposure) and cold (minimum radiation exposure) extremes. Depending on the planet's makeup, the resulting seasonal dynamics may include ecological and meteorological cycles which may form the basis for further divisions of the cycle (e.g. rainy season, dry season, wildfire season).

property_value: IAO:0000116 "This branch of the ontology deals with causal relations between entities. It is divided into two branches: causal relations between occurrents/processes, and causal relations between material entities. We take an 'activity flow-centric approach', with the former as primary, and define causal relations between material entities in terms of causal relations between occurrents.\n\nTo define causal relations in an activity-flow type network, we make use of 3 primitives:\n\n * Temporal: how do the intervals of the two occurrents relate? \n * Is the causal relation regulatory?\n * Is the influence positive or negative\n\nThe first of these can be formalized in terms of the Allen Interval Algebra. Informally, the 3 bins we care about are 'direct', 'indirect' or overlapping. Note that all causal relations should be classified under a RO temporal relation (see the branch under 'temporally related to'). Note that all causal relations are temporal, but not all temporal relations are causal. Two occurrents can be related in time without being causally connected. We take causal influence to be primitive, elucidated as being such that has the upstream changed, some qualities of the donwstream would necessarily be modified.\n\nFor the second, we consider a relationship to be regulatory if the system in which the activities occur is capable of altering the relationship to achieve some objective. This could include changing the rate of production of a molecule.\n\nFor the third, we consider the effect of the upstream process on the output(s) of the downstream process.

Containment is location not involving parthood, and arises only where some immaterial continuant is involved.

Thus if cells of type C1 derive_from cells of type C, then any cell division involving an instance of C1 in a given lineage is preceded_by cellular processes involving an instance of C.    The assertion P preceded_by P1 tells us something about Ps in general: that is, it tells us something about what happened earlier, given what we know about what happened later. Thus it does not provide information pointing in the opposite direction, concerning instances of P1 in general; that is, that each is such as to be succeeded by some instance of P. Note that an assertion to the effect that P preceded_by P1 is rather weak; it tells us little about the relations between the underlying instances in virtue of which the preceded_by relation obtains. Typically we will be interested in stronger relations, for example in the relation immediately_preceded_by, or in relations which combine preceded_by with a condition to the effect that the corresponding instances of P and P1 share participants, or that their participants are connected by relations of derivation, or (as a first step along the road to a treatment of causality) that the one process in some way affects (for example, initiates or regulates) the other." xsd:string
