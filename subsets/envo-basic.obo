comment: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ The term body of water most often refers to large accumulations of water, such as oceans, seas, and lakes, but it includes smaller pools of water such as ponds, wetlands, or more rarely, puddles. A body of water does not have to be still or contained; Rivers, streams, canals, and other geographical features where water moves from one place to another are also considered bodies of water.

comment: A mountain is generally steeper than a hill, but there is no universally accepted standard definition for the height of a mountain or a hill although a mountain usually has an identifiable summit. The USGS had previously defined mountains as localised elevations of more than 300 meters; however, the organisation has accepted there are no technical definitions in the US. In ENVO, we primarily use the UNEP-WCMC classification to be compliant with SDG monitoring, but we can host other classifications on request: http://www.fao.org/sustainable-development-goals/indicators/1542/en/

Tree cover alone is not enough to distinguish between forests and plantations. The international definition proposed by the 2010 FAO Forestry Resource Assessment: "land spanning more than 0.5 ha with trees higher than 5 metres and canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ . It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use." - FAO.  2010. Global forest resources assessment 2010, Main report, FAO Forestry Paper 163. Rome.

They are typically composed of sand, although could be of any granular matter that the moving water has access to and is capable of shifting around (for example, soil, silt, gravel, cobble, shingle, or even boulders). The grain size of the material comprising a bar is related: to the size of the waves or the strength of the currents moving the material, but the availability of material to be worked by waves and currents is also important."

Where the direction of the shore turns inland (reenters) the longshore current spreads out or dissipates. No longer able to carry the full load, much of the sediment is dropped.

In fine grained soils, capillary action can cause the pores of the soil to be fully saturated above the water table at a pressure less than atmospheric. In such soils, therefore, the unsaturated zone is the upper section of the vadose zone and not identical to it.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_shelf, https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4808-4736]
comment: An ice shelf may grow hundreds of miles out to sea.  Usually of great horizontal extent and with a level or gently undulating surface. Nourished by annual snow accumulation and also by the seaward extension of land glaciers. Limited areas may be aground. Ice shelves are much thicker than sea ice often filling embayments in the coastline of an ice sheet.. Currently, nearly all ice shelves are in Antarctica, where most of the ice discharged into the ocean flows via ice shelves. The mass balance of an ice shelf may have significant components of both gain and loss at the base. The seaward edge is termed an ice front.  The calving of an ice shelf forms tabular icebergs and ice islands. {xref="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4808-4736"}

The sharp-edged boulders carried at the bottom of the glacier erode the softer rock more quickly by abrasion, thus creating a hollow called a rock basin. On either side of the rock basin, the more resistant rock is eroded less and these outcrops of harder rock are known as rock bars, which act as dams between which rainwater may accumulate after the retreat of the ice age, filling up the rock basin and creating a ribbon lake. A ribbon lake may also form behind a terminal or recessional moraine, both of which also act as dams, enabling water to accumulate behind them. A ribbon lake may also occur if a tributary glacier joins a main glacier. The increase in power can create a trough, which is filled with water from a river/meltwater to create a ribbon lake."

def: "A frost heave which is formed as the result of a perennial ice lens forming under soil, pushing a roughly oval portion land surface upwards." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palsa]
comment: Palsas typically occur in areas with discontinuous permafrost, frequently peat bogs. A palsa consists, similarly to a pingo, of an ice core and overlying soil materials, in case of a palsa usually boggy soil. Palsas are characteristically found in areas with discontinuous permafrost and in such areas bay be the only reliable surface evidence of permafrost. A palsa needs large quantities of water for the formation of its ice core (i.e. ice lens), which is why they frequently emerge from and are bound by boggy soils, which can store enormous quantities of water in their pores. Palsas develop particularly in moorlands and are therefore also named palsamoors.

def: "Soil is an environmental material which is primarily composed of minerals, varying proportions of sand, silt, and clay, organic material such as humus, gases, liquids, and a broad range of resident micro- and macroorganisms." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil]
comment: 'In engineering terms, soil is referred to as regolith, or loose rock material that lies above the 'solid geology'. Soil is commonly referred to as "earth" or "dirt"; technically, the term "dirt" should be restricted to displaced soil.' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil\n\n" The upper limit of soil is the boundary between soil and air, shallow water, live plants, or plant materials that have not begun to decompose. Areas are not considered to have soil if the surface is permanently covered by water too deep (typically more than 2.5 meters) for the growth of rooted plants.\n\nThe lower boundary that separates soil from the nonsoil underneath is most difficult to define. Soil consists of horizons near the Earth's surface that, in contrast to the underlying parent material, have been altered by the interactions of climate, relief, and living organisms over time. Commonly, soil grades at its lower boundary to hard rock or to earthy materials virtually devoid of animals, roots, or other marks of biological activity. For purposes of classification, the lower boundary of soil is arbitrarily set at 200 cm."

comment: ENVO bodily fluid classes differ from UBERON's treatment of bodily fluids. UBERON refers to the substance itself ("S"). We assert that UBERON's classes are the primary compositional component of the terms in ENVO ("S material").

comment: In the United States, NOAA sea ice operations does not include superstructure icing as being sea ice. In sea ice operations however, sea ice is any form of ice found at sea which has originated from the freezing of sea water. It presents the main kind of floating ice encountered at sea. Except where it forms ridges, sea ice is up to a few metres thick, in which respect it differs from shelf ice.  Sea ice may be discontinuous pieces (ice floes) moved on the ocean surface by wind and currents (pack ice), or a motionless sheet attached to the coast (land-fast ice). In brief, it forms first as lolly ice (frazil crystals), thickens into sludge, and coagulates into sheet ice, pancake ice, or into floes of various shapes and sizes. Thereafter, sea ice may develop into pack ice and/or become a form of pressure ice.  Sea ice less than one year old is called first-year ice. Perennial ice is sea ice that survives at least one summer. It may be subdivided into second-year ice and multi-year ice, where multiyear ice has survived at least two summers. {comment="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4808-4736"}

comment: 'Terminology differs between countries. For example, in the United States, the entire dairy farm is commonly called a "dairy." The building or farm area where milk is harvested from the cow is often called a "milking parlor" or "parlor." The farm area where milk is stored in bulk tanks is known as the farm's "milk house." Milk is then hauled (usually by truck) to a "dairy plant," also referred to as a "dairy", where raw milk is further processed and prepared for commercial sale of dairy products. In New Zealand, farm areas for milk harvesting are also called "milking parlours", and are historically known as "milking sheds."' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy

comment: This class is distinct from a geometric surface, which is two-dimensional. The idea of "uppermost" may be problematic. Further, the definition of layer (the superclass of surface in rev 133) references surface. This may be another issue. Perhaps this can be made into an inferred class using 'bounding layer of' some material entity, note that 'bounding layer' implies containment, which may not be valid here.

def: "MERGED DEFINITION:\nTARGET DEFINITION: An oceanographic feature that involves wind-driven motion of dense, cooler, and usually nutrient-rich water towards the ocean surface, replacing the warmer, usually nutrient-deplete surface water.\n--------------------\nSOURCE DEFINITION: A marine upwelling is a net flow of marine water to the surface of the water column from deeper regions. This is often a result of surface water displacement off continental coasts by wind action. Localised upwellings may also occur along divergent fronts around eddies and along some of the major oceanographic features. Deeper waters often have higher nutrient content; consequently blooms of primary producers, such as planktonic algae, are generally observed around upwelling zones."

name: silt
def: "Silt is granular material of a size somewhere between sand and clay whose mineral origin is quartz and feldspar." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silt]
comment: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ In the Udden-Wentworth scale (due to Krumbein), silt particles range between 0.0039 to 0.0625 mm, larger than clay but smaller than sand particles. ISO 14688 grades silts between 0.002 mm and 0.063 mm. In actuality, silt is chemically distinct from clay, and unlike clay, grains of silt are approximately the same size in all dimensions; furthermore, their size ranges overlap. Clays are formed from thin plate-shaped particles held together by electrostatic forces, so present a cohesion. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture Soil Texture Classification system, the sand-silt distinction is made at the 0.05 mm particle size. The USDA system has been adopted by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). In the Unified Soil Classification System (USCS) and the AASHTO Soil Classification system, the sand-silt distinction is made at the 0.075 mm particle size (i.e., material passing the #200 sieve). Silts and clays are distinguished mechanically by their plasticity.

name: marine surface current
def: "A marine current bordered by the surface of the water column and the permanent thermocline, where it occurs. Surface currents are mostly wind driven and mostly limited to the top 400 m of the water column. Ocean currents are driven by the circulation of wind above surface waters. Frictional stress at the interface between the ocean and the wind causes the water to move in the direction of the wind. Large ocean currents are a response of the atmosphere and ocean to the flow of energy from the tropics to polar regions. In some cases, currents are transient features and affect only a small area. Other ocean currents are essentially permanent and extend over large horizontal distances."

However, in deeper water (depths of 2,000 m/6,600 ft or greater), fewer scavenger species exist, and the carcass can provide sustenance for a complex localized ecosystem over periods of decades."

At low elevations, this typically results in eight months of the year having average temperatures greater than or equal to 10 degrees Celsius with the coldest monthly temperature averaging between 2 and 13 degrees Celsius." []
comment: As with most other climatic zones and conditions, multiple classification schemes have somehat different definitions and criteria. To quote from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ "Several methods have been used to define the subtropical climate. In the Trewartha climate classification, a subtropical region should have at least eight months with a mean temperature of 10 °C (50.0 °F) or above. German climatologists Carl Troll and Karlheinz Paffen defined Warm temperate zones as plain and hilly lands having an average temperature of the coldest month between 2 °C (35.6 °F) and 13 °C (55.4 °F) in the Northern Hemisphere and between 6 °C (42.8 °F) and 13 °C (55.4 °F) in the Southern Hemisphere, excluding oceanic and continental climates. According to the Troll-Paffen climate classification, there generally exists one large subtropical zone named the warm-temperate subtropical zone,[4] which is subdivided into seven smaller areas.[5]\n\nAccording to the E. Neef climate classification, the subtropical zone is divided into two parts: Rainy winters of the west sides and Eastern subtropical climate.[6] According to the Wilhelm Lauer & Peter Frankenberg climate classification, the subtropical zone is divided into three parts: high-continental, continental, and maritime.[7] According to the Siegmund/Frankenberg climate classification, subtropical is one of six climate zones in the world.[8]"

comment: A similar term exists in linguistics and mathematics. An ecocline, or biological cline, is a related concept; however, may be better placed as a child of a class like "ecotone". Further, some definitions of "layer" require a layer's constiuent materials to have consistent properties, thus "cline" would not qualify as a subclass.

comment: There is debate on the usage of mudstone and mudrock, and some ambiguity is to be expected. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ The terminology of "mudstone" is not to be confused with the Dunham classification scheme for limestones. In Dunham's classification, a mudstone is any limestone containing less than ten percent carbonate grains. Note, a siliciclastic mudstone does not deal with carbonate grains. Friedman, Sanders, and Kopaska-Merkel (1992) suggest the use of "lime mudstone" to avoid confusion with siliciclastic rocks.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ecozone]
comment: ENVO contains this top-level class, but all instances will be in GAZ. The definition is preliminary and will be aligned to BFO.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/  Ecozones correspond to the floristic kingdoms of botany or zoogeographic regions of zoology. Ecozones are characterized by the evolutionary history of the organisms they contain. They are distinct from biomes, also known as major habitat types, which are divisions of the Earth's surface based on life form, or the adaptation of plants and animals to climatic, soil, and other conditions. Biomes are characterized by similar climax vegetation. Each ecozone may include a number of different biomes. A tropical moist broadleaf forest in Central America, for example, may be similar to one in New Guinea in its vegetation type and structure, climate, soils, etc., but these forests are inhabited by plants and animals with very different evolutionary histories.

comment: This variant of the desert climate is somewhat rare outside of Asia. A cold desert climate is typically found in temperate zones, almost always in the rain shadow of high mountains which restrict precipitation from the westerly winds, or in the case of Central Asia, from the monsoon. The Gobi desert in Mongolia is a classic example of a region with a cold desert climate. Though hot in summer, it shares the very cold winters of the rest of Central Asia. The Kyzyl Kum and Taklamakan deserts of Central Asia and the drier portions of the Great Basin Desert of the western United States are other major examples of BWk climates. The Ladakh region, lying in the Great Himalayas in India also has a cold desert climate.

def: "A wet meadow is a type of wetland with soils that are saturated with water for part or all of the growing season." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_meadow]
comment: Debate exists whether a wet meadow is a type of marsh or a completely separate type of wetland. Wet prairies and wet savannas are hydrologically similar. Wet meadows may occur because of restricted drainage or the receipt of large amounts of water from rain or melted snow. They may also occur in riparian zones and around the shores of large lakes. Unlike a marsh or swamp, a wet meadow does not have standing water present except for brief to moderate periods during the growing season. Instead, the ground in a wet meadow fluctuates between brief periods of inundation and longer periods of saturation. Wet meadows often have large numbers of wetland plant species, which frequently survive as buried seeds during dry periods, and then regenerate after flooding. Wet meadows therefore do not usually support aquatic life such as fish. They typically have a high diversity of plant species, and may attract large numbers of birds, small mammals and insects including butterflies. {xref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_meadow"}

Further, according to Black's Law Dictionary (http://thelawdictionary.org/furniture/) many classes can be subclasses of 'piece of furntiure': "This term includes that which furnishes, or with which anything is furnished or supplied; whatever must be supplied to a house, a room, or the like, to make it habitable, convenient, or agreeable; goods, vessels, utensils, and other appendages necessary or convenient for housekeeping; whatever is added to the interior of a house or apartment, for use or convenience. Bell v. Holding, 27 Ind. 173.The term “furniture” embraces everything about the house that has been usually enjoyed there, including plate, linen, china, and pictures. 1 Endicott v. Endicott, 41N. J. Eq. 96, 3 Atl. 157.The word “furniture” made use of in the disposition of the law. or in the conventions or acts of persons, comprehends only such furniture as is intended for use and ornament of apartments, but not libraries which happen to be there, nor plate. Civ.Code La. art. 477." However, this would eventually be absurd and limit other groupings. Perhaps some sort of 'furnishing' BFO:function would be a better way to handle this.

comment: In 1988, the FAO introduced a definition of aquaculture which reduces its confusion with capture fisheries: Aquaculture is the farming of aquatic organisms, including fish, molluscs, crustaceans and aquatic plants. Farming implies some form of intervention in the rearing process to enhance production, such as regular stocking, feeding, protection from predators, etc. Farming also implies individual or corporate ownership of the stock being cultivated. For statistical purposes, aquatic organisms which are harvested by an individual or corporate body which has owned them throughout their rearing period contribute to aquaculture, while aquatic organisms which are exploitable by the public as a common property resources, with or without appropriate licences, are the harvest of fisheries.

comment: Note that this ENVO class is not authoritative: see the associated IUCN references for a complete definition of all Protected Areas. Further, note that the use of "natural" in the IUCN definition may allow for some anthropisation such as the presence of cave dwellings or spiritual sites. These areas tend to be smaller than other IUCN protected areas and are sites of frequent human visitation and high tourism value. They often serve to conserve natural heritage in land- or seascapes which have otherwise been anthropised. Frequently, these areas have high spiritual and cultural value as well as bio- and geodiversity value. It is not clear what would happen to the status of a IUCN Category III protected area if its key natural monument dies or degrades.

comment: Magentospheres are generated by the motion of active hot iron and nickle or metallic planetary cores or by the interactions of plasma in stars.. The magnetic field near the surface of many astronomical bodies resembles that of a dipole. The field lines farther away from the surface can be significantly distorted by the flow of electrically conducting plasma emitted from a nearby star. The structure and behaviour of magnetospheres depend on numerous variables, including the type of astronomical body which generates it, the period of the object's spin, the properties of the axis about which the object spins, the axis of the magnetic dipole, and the magnitude and direction of the flow of stellar wind. {xref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetosphere"}

comment: The definitions of forest can vary greatly, and different classes will be needed to support the major categories. Tree cover alone is not enough to distinguish between forests and plantations. The international definition proposed by the 2010 FAO Forestry Resource Assessment: "land spanning more than 0.5 ha with trees higher than 5 metres and canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ . It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use." - FAO.  2010. Global forest resources assessment 2010, Main report, FAO Forestry Paper 163. Rome.

The event must be intense enough, occur in a large enough area, and persist for enough time to allow the formed particle population to be observed. There are no exact or universally agreed upon thresholds for the intensity, area and duration of such events. If elevated new particle formation rate is observed in the atmosphere (away from direct sources of the related gas-phase molecules) for an operationally defined period of time, practitioners often declare that such an event has taken place. {xref="https://github.com/EnvironmentOntology/envo/issues/602"}

CMECS provides the following notes: "Commonly found on intertidal mud flats along the shores of estuaries. Tidal mangrove shrublands may include immature stands or stunted mature trees that indicate a harsh growing environment. Areas characterized by tall mangroves (> 6 meters) are placed in the Tidal Mangrove Forest Biotic Group. Where tidal amplitude is relatively low, the vegetation forms narrow bands along the coastal plains, and it rarely penetrates inland more than several kilometers along rivers. Where tidal amplitude is greater, mangroves extend further inland along river courses, forming extensive stands in the major river deltas. Also, mangrove cays may occur within the lagoon complex of barrier reefs. The list of biotic communities for this group is long: a few examples are provided below, and the complete list is available in Appendix F"

name: tundra ecosystem
def: "An ecosystem which 1) typically has monthly average temperatures below 10 degrees Celsius 2) has a low evapotranspiration ratio 3) is dominated by treeless terrain, covered by communities of low-growing vegetation such as dwarf shrubs, sedges and grasses, mosses, and lichens, 4) contains areas of soil underlain by permafrost with a thin active layer and 5) occurs in both polar and alpine regions (i.e., both high latitudes and high altitudes), and 5) does not have permanent snow or ice cover." [https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4808-4736] {comment="This definition is a synthesis of the following sources: NSIDC Glossary accessed 2016, IPCC WGII AR5 2014, Van Everdingen International Permafrost Association 2005, AMS - glossary of meteorology, PhysicalGeography.net"}
comment: Tundra ecosysems are often underlaid by permafrost, with the result that drainage is bad and the soil may be saturated for long periods. It does not have a permanent snow-ice cover.  Productivity is low in this biome because of the extremes of climate.

def: "A secondary aerosol formation process which occurs in an atmosphere at an increased rate relative to background processes of the same kind." [https://github.com/EnvironmentOntology/envo/issues/602]
comment: Note that the detection of such events, and thus the thresholds used to define them in the field, are operational and dependent on the technology and observation strategy used. The event must be intense enough, occur in a large enough area, and persist for enough time to allow the formed particle population to be observed. There are no exact or universally agreed upon thresholds for the intensity, area and duration of such events. If elevated new particle formation rate is observed in the atmosphere (away from direct sources of the related gas-phase molecules) for an operationally defined period of time, practitioners often declare that such an event has taken place. {xref="https://github.com/EnvironmentOntology/envo/issues/602"}

comment: Assemblages within provinces will show endemism, principally at the level of species. While this may be partly explained by historical isolation, abiotic environmental features and coniditions will play a strong role. These may include geomorphological features (isolated island and shelf systems, semi-enclosed seas); hydrographic features (currents, upwellings, ice dynamics); or geochemical influences (broadest-scale elements of nutrient supply and salinity).” Examples include Cold Temperate Northeast Pacific, Tropical Northwestern Atlantic, and Cold Temperate Northeast Pacific.

This is deprecated, with pack ice now referring to drift ice with a concentration equal to or above 7/10; however, other usages are still common.

comment: Fast ice is central to the livelihoods of Arctic coastal communities who use it to access fishing and hunting grounds. Vertical fluctuations may be observed during changes of sea level. Fast ice may be formed on site from sea water or by freezing of pack ice of any age to the shore, and it may extend a few yards (meters) or several hundred miles (kilometers) from the coast. Fast ice may be more than one year old and may then be prefixed with appropriate age category (old, second- year, or multiyear). If it is thicker than about 7 ft (2 m) above sea level, it is called an ice shelf. {xref="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4808-4736"}

comment: Typically 3 to 4 millimeters in diameter. These may form in both marine water and fresh water. They represent the first stages of sea ice growth; they merge under calm conditions to form thin sheets of ice on the surface (frazil ice), and consist of nearly pure fresh water. In fresh water, they form in supercooled water that is too turbulent to permit coagulation into sheet ice.  This is most common in swiftly flowing streams. They may accumulate as anchor ice on submerged objects obstructing the water flow. {xref="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4808-4736"}

comment: The greater part of an iceberg's mass (4/5 to 8/9) is below sea level, which makes them dangerous to shipping in high and mid-latitude regions of the ocean. The top of an ice berg usually protrudes more than 5 m above water-level and typically extends from tens of meters to many tens of kilometres across. Icebergs may be described as tabular, dome-shaped, sloping, pinnacled, dry-docked, blocky, weathered or glacier bergs in addition to having a size qualifier. Icebergs are not sea ice, when they melt they add fresh water to the ocean.  The unmodified term "iceberg" usually refers to the irregular masses of ice formed by the calving of glaciers along an orographically rough coast, whereas tabular icebergs and ice islands are calved from an ice shelf, while bergs formed from sea ice are called floebergs. In decreasing size, they are classified as: ice island (few thousand square meters to 500 km^2 in area); tabular iceberg; iceberg; bergy bit (less than 5 m above sea level, between 1 and 200 m^2 in area); and growler (less than 1 m above sea level, about 20 m^2 in area). Alaskan icebergs rarely exceed 500 feet in maximum dimension.  Antarctic icebergs originate from the ice mass of the Antarctic continent that has accumulated over many thousands of years. {xref="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4808-4736"}

comment: Land ice is any part of the Earth's seasonal or perennial ice cover that has formed over land as the result, principally, of the freezing of precipitation; opposed to sea ice formed by the freezing of seawater.  Thus, an iceberg or tabular iceberg is land ice as well as its parent glacier, ice sheet, or ice shelf. The two major concentrations of land ice are the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica. Glaciers and ice caps are the other important forms; however, some members of the glaciology community hold that glaciers (i.e. rock glaciers) need not have any ice. {xref="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4808-4736"}

comment: This term is used both as a process and as an amount of mass added. Semantically speaking these are two distinct concepts (e.g., accumulation results in accumulation_amount of ice or snow gain), though accumulation_amount would more likely be an attribute.\n\nThe scope of this term varies depending on the definition.  Some definitions constrain themselves snow or ice added to glaciers; while others also include ice fields, snow cover, and/or floating ice.  How to resolve this depends on the scope desired.\n\nSome definitions include additional discussion of the the physics involved which would be useful for connecting glacier ontologies to atmospheric, hydrologic, etc. ontologies.  This information should be captured no matter how the inconsistencies above are resolved.

name: glacial summer surface
def: "A glacial surface layer which is present at the point in time where any given part of a glacier reaches its minimum annual mass." [http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4808-4736]
comment: Note that the glacial summer surface is diachronous. The time that the summer surface is present on a glacier can vary from point to point along the entire glacier. That is, while a high-elevation region of a glacier may have reached its minimum, lower elevation regions may still be ablating. The summer surface is the surface on which the first snow of the new balance year falls.\nIt is easily detectable when it consists of glacier ice, which now includes superimposed ice added during the previous balance year. In the firn area it is recognizable as a well-marked crust, that is, a thin, relatively strong layer with a density near that of ice, and sometimes also (or instead) as a layer of depth hoar at the base of the current year's accumulation. The crust typically originates by recrystallization of the surface snow in late summer to form glaze.\nIt may also be marked by an accumulation of sediment or wind-blown dust. It can be difficult to detect when melting and snowfall alternate during the transition between the ablation season and the accumulation season. In some mass-balance programmes the summer surface is 'labelled' in the vicinity of stakes with a distinctive material, such as sawdust, during a visit late in the ablation season.

comment: Frost action in soils describes the processes of Frost Heave that occurs in the ground during the freezing period, and Thaw Weakening that occurs as the seasonally Frozen Ground thaws. Although it normally refers to seasonal freezing and thawing processes and effects, the term Frost action has also been used to describe the long-term heaving that occurs when soils are subjected continuously to a freezing temperature over a long period of time (years). Frost action contributes to the mechanical weathering (disintegration or breakdown) of soil and rock materials, by frost wedging, Cryoturbation activity, and to the development of cryotexture and cryogenic fabric in soils. {xref="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4808-4736"}

comment: The processes that form irregular structures in earth materials characterized by folded, broken and dislocated beds, and lenses of unconsolidated deposits, including organic horizons and even bedrock.  These processes include deep frost penetration, frost action, frost heaving, thaw settlement and all differential movements, including expansion and contraction due to temperature changes and the growth and disappearance of ground ice bodies, whether perennial or seasonal.  Low temperatures alone are not enough to produce cryoturbation; the water-ice phase change is necessary.  Cryoturbation is an important process in the development of patterned ground.

comment: Depth hoar is associated with very fast crystal growth under large temperature gradients. Sometimes a layer of depth hoar forms just above, and may assist in identifying, the summer surface. The low density and low strength of depth hoar can make it difficult to retrieve unbroken core sections during coring, and can complicate estimates of accumulation by microwave remote sensing. Layers of depth hoar also increase the likelihood of avalanching. This is one way in which firn formation may begin. Depth hoar is similar in physical origin to crevasse hoar.  A type of hoarfrost.

comment: Sea ice develops from young ice; thickness from 0.3 to 2 meters (1 to 6.6 feet).  Sea ice be subdivided into thin first-year ice (white ice), medium first-year ice, and thick first-year ice.  First-year ice is distinguished from older ice primarily by having a higher salinity. Undeformed first-year ice differs from older ice in that it is smoother and lacks refrozen melt ponds. Characteristically level where undisturbed by pressure, but where ridges occur, they  distinguished by being larger, more angular, and more porous than multiyear ridges. {xref="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4808-4736"}

def: "A fire which is planned and executed deliberately under human supervision." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_burn]
comment: Fire-stick farming was the practice of Indigenous Australians who regularly used fire to burn vegetation to facilitate hunting and to change the composition of plant and animal species in an area. Aboriginal people may have been able to aim the burning of the scrub to avoid growing areas. There may have been a ritual taboo against burning certain areas of jungle. This type of farming directly increased the food supply for Aboriginal people by promoting the growth of bush potatoes and other edible ground-level plants. {xref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire-stick_farming"}
comment: Planned burns are conducted for a variety of reasons such combating or preventing uncontrolled wildfires in order by reducing the fuel load in a wooded or similar areas with combustible vegetation. Alternatively planned burns, such as those practiced by various indigenous people, are conducted for a variety of reasons including facilitating agriculture, hunting and or traveling. As well as managing populations of parasitic species or game animals by decreasing or increasing the size of their habitats respectively. {xref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_American_use_of_fire_in_ecosystems#Reasons_for_and_Benefits_of_burning"}
