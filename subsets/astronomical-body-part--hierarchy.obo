comment: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ The term body of water most often refers to large accumulations of water, such as oceans, seas, and lakes, but it includes smaller pools of water such as ponds, wetlands, or more rarely, puddles. A body of water does not have to be still or contained; Rivers, streams, canals, and other geographical features where water moves from one place to another are also considered bodies of water.

comment: A mountain is generally steeper than a hill, but there is no universally accepted standard definition for the height of a mountain or a hill although a mountain usually has an identifiable summit. The USGS had previously defined mountains as localised elevations of more than 300 meters; however, the organisation has accepted there are no technical definitions in the US. In ENVO, we primarily use the UNEP-WCMC classification to be compliant with SDG monitoring, but we can host other classifications on request: http://www.fao.org/sustainable-development-goals/indicators/1542/en/

def: "A linear shoaling landform feature within a body of water. Bars tend to be long and narrow (linear) and develop where a current (or waves) promote deposition of granular material, resulting in localized shallowing (shoaling) of the water. Bars can appear in the sea, in a lake, or in a river. They are typically composed of sand, although could be of any granular matter that the moving water has access to and is capable of shifting around (for example, soil, silt, gravel, cobble, shingle, or even boulders). The grain size of the material comprising a bar is related: to the size of the waves or the strength of the currents moving the material, but the availability of material to be worked by waves and currents is also important."

Where the direction of the shore turns inland (reenters) the longshore current spreads out or dissipates. No longer able to carry the full load, much of the sediment is dropped. This causes a bar to build out from the shore, eventually becoming a spit." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spit_%28landform%29]

name: ribbon lake
def: "A lake that is long, narrow, and finger-shaped, usually found in a glacial trough. Its formation begins when a glacier moves over an area containing alternate bands of hard and soft bedrock. The sharp-edged boulders carried at the bottom of the glacier erode the softer rock more quickly by abrasion, thus creating a hollow called a rock basin. On either side of the rock basin, the more resistant rock is eroded less and these outcrops of harder rock are known as rock bars, which act as dams between which rainwater may accumulate after the retreat of the ice age, filling up the rock basin and creating a ribbon lake. A ribbon lake may also form behind a terminal or recessional moraine, both of which also act as dams, enabling water to accumulate behind them. A ribbon lake may also occur if a tributary glacier joins a main glacier. The increase in power can create a trough, which is filled with water from a river/meltwater to create a ribbon lake."

comment: Palsas typically occur in areas with discontinuous permafrost, frequently peat bogs. A palsa consists, similarly to a pingo, of an ice core and overlying soil materials, in case of a palsa usually boggy soil. Palsas are characteristically found in areas with discontinuous permafrost and in such areas bay be the only reliable surface evidence of permafrost. A palsa needs large quantities of water for the formation of its ice core (i.e. ice lens), which is why they frequently emerge from and are bound by boggy soils, which can store enormous quantities of water in their pores. Palsas develop particularly in moorlands and are therefore also named palsamoors.

comment: This class is defined in its geological sense:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Hydrologically, an oceanic basin may be anywhere on Earth that is covered by seawater, but geologically ocean basins are large geologic basins that are below sea level. Geologically, there are other undersea geomorphological features such as the continental shelves, the deep ocean trenches, and the undersea mountain ranges (for example, the mid-Atlantic ridge) which are not considered to be part of the ocean basins; while hydrologically, oceanic basins include the flanking continental shelves and shallow, epeiric seas.

This is often a result of surface water displacement off continental coasts by wind action. Localised upwellings may also occur along divergent fronts around eddies and along some of the major oceanographic features. Deeper waters often have higher nutrient content; consequently blooms of primary producers, such as planktonic algae, are generally observed around upwelling zones."

Marine mesoscale eddies are between about 10 and 500 km in diameter, and persist for periods of days to months. They may be formed when an ocean current develops an instability.

Surface currents are mostly wind driven and mostly limited to the top 400 m of the water column. Ocean currents are driven by the circulation of wind above surface waters. Frictional stress at the interface between the ocean and the wind causes the water to move in the direction of the wind. Large ocean currents are a response of the atmosphere and ocean to the flow of energy from the tropics to polar regions. In some cases, currents are transient features and affect only a small area. Other ocean currents are essentially permanent and extend over large horizontal distances."

comment: Note that the definition of the term mineral is debatable; however, a mineral generally must be naturally occuring, stable at room temperature, representable by a chemical formula (unlike rocks, which may include a wide variety of components), are usually formed by geophysical processes (i.e. are abiogenic), and have an ordered atomic arrangement.

def: "A lake which is composed primarily water with high concentrations of humic substances and organic acids, resulting in brown- or tea-coloured colouration." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystrophic_lake]
comment: In response to historical misuse of the term in literature, these lakes are better referred to as "humic lakes". Although dystrophic lakes are often considered acidic and nutrient-poor (oligotrophic), these lakes actually vary greatly in terms of both pH and productivity. Due to the low pH associated with dystrophic lakes, few bacterial species and other aquatic life are able to survive. They are common in the taiga of North America and Eurasia. {xref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystrophic_lake"}

comment: Typically 3 to 4 millimeters in diameter. These may form in both marine water and fresh water. They represent the first stages of sea ice growth; they merge under calm conditions to form thin sheets of ice on the surface (frazil ice), and consist of nearly pure fresh water. In fresh water, they form in supercooled water that is too turbulent to permit coagulation into sheet ice.  This is most common in swiftly flowing streams. They may accumulate as anchor ice on submerged objects obstructing the water flow. {xref="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4808-4736"}
