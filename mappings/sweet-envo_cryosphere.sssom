ENVO:03000002	firn	sweet:matrWater/Firn	firn	skos:closeMatch	HumanCurated	SWEET has it as subclass to ice crystal which is probably not correct with the definition of firn we've come across. This could be refined in SWEET. If it is put as a subclass of snow it would be a candidate exact match.
ENVO:03000071	first year ice	sweet:realmCryo/SeasonalIce	seasonal ice	skos:relatedMatch	HumanCurated	This SWEET term maps even more closely to ENVO area of seasonal sea ice
ENVO:00000039	fjord	sweet:realmHydroBody/Fiord	fiord	skos:closeMatch	HumanCurated	SWEET considers fjords to be a subtype of estuary - ENVO doesn't.

ENVO:03400010	freezing rain	sweet:phenAtmoPrecipitation/FreezingRain	freezing rain	skos:relatedMatch	HumanCurated	In ENVO we have the process and the object resulting from it the latter here, in SWEET it's the object resulting from the process. 
ENVO:01000896	freezing rainfall	sweet:phenAtmoPrecipitation/FreezingRain	freezing rain	skos:closeMatch	HumanCurated	In ENVO this is a process while in SWEET it is a type of Atmospheric precipitation which is a phenomenon which likely means process but this isn't guaranteed.

obo:CHEBI_76413	greenhouse gas	sweet:matr/GreenhouseGas	greenhouse gas	skos:relatedMatch	HumanCurated	This mapping is between a role and material entity, important example of semantic clarification provided by more expressive ontology framework, (i.e., there is no material entity that is a greenhouse gas, however certain gasses can bear this greenhouse role). 
ENVO:03400012	hail stone	sweet:phenAtmoPrecipitation/Hail	hail	skos:relatedMatch	HumanCurated	Within ENVO this is a material within SWEET it's a phenonema which could be either a material or process. This could be separated out better within SWEET. Candidate for close match if the SWEET hierarchy is clarified.

ENVO:01000917	ice calving process	sweet:phenCryo/IceCalving	ice calving	skos:closeMatch	HumanCurated	SWEET has no definition but the term is placed under the phenomenon heirarchy which is the equivalent of ENVO's processes
ENVO:00000145	ice cap	sweet:realmCryo/IceCap	ice cap	skos:relatedMatch	HumanCurated	In ENVO ice cap is a type of ice mass; while in SWEET it is a realm. The notion of realm in SWEET and the way it's subclassed indicates that its top-level semantics need revision. An ice cap is not a realm, but part of a realm (probably). 
ENVO:00000299	ice field	sweet:realmCryo/IceField	ice field	skos:relatedMatch	HumanCurated	In SWEET ice field is sea ice; whereas in ENVO an ice cap is just a planetary body part

The relations between the two term's superclass is what leads us to say related instead of close.
ENVO:00000542	kame	sweet:realmLandGlacial/Kame	kame	skos:relatedMatch	HumanCurated	In SWEET a kame is a glacial landform - a type of geometrical object; in ENVO a kame is a kind of material entity.
ENVO:03400007	lake-effect snow storm	sweet:phenAtmoPrecipitation/LakeEffectSnowstorm	lake effect snowstorm	skos:closeMatch	HumanCurated	Candidate Exact match. SWEET needs a definition and depending on what that becomes this could become exact match

ENVO:01000981	mass liquid flow	sweet:phenSystem/Flow	flow	skos:broadMatch	HumanCurated	Assuming subclasses of change in SWEET are processes (BFO process) but some terms in the hierarchy are debatable
ENVO:01000690	mass wasting	sweet:phenGeolGeomorphology/MassWasting	mass wasting	skos:closeMatch	HumanCurated	SWEET hierarchy looks to be a process like in ENVO's. A candidate for exact match if SWEET adds ENVO's definition to SWEET's term.
ENVO:01000696	mass wasting flow	sweet:phenGeolGeomorphology/MassWasting	mass wasting	skos:broadMatch	HumanCurated	ENVO term's parent is close match.
ENVO:03000009	material accumulation process	sweet:phenSystem/Accumulation	accumulation	skos:relatedMatch	HumanCurated	The ENVO term is a process; while in SWEETs system phenomena covers several things quality or process.
ENVO:03000010	material transport process	sweet:phenFluidTransport/Transport	transport	skos:relatedMatch	HumanCurated	Relationship is unclear. The SWEET hierarchy doesn't specify what's transported can't tell if it's material or not.

ENVO:00000177	moraine	sweet:realmLandGlacial/GlacialMoraine	glacial moraine	skos:relatedMatch	HumanCurated	In SWEET this is a subclass of plain, but actually it is not a flat landform!
ENVO:00000177	moraine	sweet:realmLandGlacial/Moraine	moraine	skos:relatedMatch	HumanCurated	In SWEET this is a subclass of plain, but actually it is not a flat landform!
ENVO:00000181	nunatak	sweet:realmLandOrographic/Summit	summit	skos:broadMatch	HumanCurated	In SWEET these are geospatial entities, not physical entities; so at best a broader match.
ENVO:00000181	nunatak	sweet:reprSpaceGeometry/Peak	peak	skos:broadMatch	HumanCurated	In SWEET these are geospatial entities, not physical entities; so at best a broader match.
ENVO:01001556	pack ice mass	sweet:realmCryo/PackIce	pack ice	skos:closeMatch	HumanCurated	A candidate for exact match if SWEET adds ENVO's definition to SWEET's term
ENVO:01001659	periglacial process	sweet:phenCryo/Periglacial	periglacial	skos:closeMatch	HumanCurated	SWEET lacks a definition but based on its position in the phenomenon branch rather than the quality ENVO:01001853
