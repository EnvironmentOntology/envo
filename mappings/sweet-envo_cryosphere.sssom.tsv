ENVO:00000155	cirque	sorealg:Cirque	cirque	skos:relatedMatch	HumanCurated	In SWEET this is a subclass of plain, but actually it is a roughly circular depression at the peak (which is a comment in SWEET), so the SWEET Heirarchy should be updated.
ENVO:03000013	cirque glacier	sorealg:Cirque	cirque	skos:relatedMatch	HumanCurated	In SWEET this is a subclass of plain, but actually it is a roughly circular depression at the peak (which is a comment in SWEET), so the SWEET Heirarchy should be updated.

ENVO:00000282	esker	sorealg:Esker	esker	skos:relatedMatch	HumanCurated	In SWEET an esker is a glacial landform - a type of geometrical object, as are ridges but the two terms are parallel concepts; in ENVO an esker is a kind of ridge and a material entity.
ENVO:03400009	falling sleet	sophatmopc:Sleet	sleet	skos:relatedMatch	HumanCurated	SWEET has confounded the material with the process (double inheritance)
ENVO:01001522	fast ice	soreac:FastIce	fast ice	skos:closeMatch	HumanCurated	A candidate for exact match if SWEET adds ENVO's definition to SWEET's term
ENVO:03000002	firn	somaw:Firn	firn	skos:closeMatch	HumanCurated	SWEET has it as subclass to ice crystal which is probably not correct with the definition of firn we've come across. This could be refined in SWEET. If it is put as a subclass of snow it would be a candidate exact match.

ENVO:00000133	glacier	soreac:Glacier	glacier	skos:closeMatch	HumanCurated	A candidate for exact match if SWEET adds ENVO's definition to SWEET's term. SWEET has this as exact match but is missing a definition.
ENVO:00000133	glacier	soreac:GlacialRegion	glacial region	skos:relatedMatch	HumanCurated	SWEET's term here is a zone.  There is no related term in ENVO so we made a related match to ENVO's glacier.
ENVO:01001529	glacier snout	soreac:GlacierTerminus	glacier terminus	skos:closeMatch	HumanCurated	A candidate for exact match if SWEET adds ENVO's definition to SWEET's term
ENVO:01001529	glacier snout	soreac:Snout	snout	skos:relatedMatch	HumanCurated	ENVO term is a mass, SWEET term is a region although both probably reffer to the same part of the glacier.

ENVO:01001876	graupel	sophatmopc:Graupel	graupel	skos:closeMatch	HumanCurated	A candidate for exact match if SWEET adds ENVO's definition to SWEET's term
obo:CHEBI_76413	greenhouse gas	soma:GreenhouseGas	greenhouse gas	skos:relatedMatch	HumanCurated	This mapping is between a role and material entity, important example of semantic clarification provided by more expressive ontology framework, (i.e., there is no material entity that is a greenhouse gas, however certain gasses can bear this greenhouse role). 
ENVO:03400012	hail stone	sophatmopc:Hail	hail	skos:relatedMatch	HumanCurated	Within ENVO this is a material within SWEET it's a phenonema which could be either a material or process. This could be separated out better within SWEET. Candidate for close match if the SWEET hierarchy is clarified.
ENVO:01000880	hailstorm	sophatmopc:HailStorm	hail storm	skos:closeMatch	HumanCurated	Candidate Exact match. Depending on SWEET's placement of phenomena.
ENVO:03400004	heavy snowfall	sophatmopc:HeavySnowfall	heavy snowfall	skos:closeMatch	HumanCurated	Candidate Exact match. Depending on SWEET's placement of phenomena.

ENVO:00000145	ice cap	soreac:IceCap	ice cap	skos:relatedMatch	HumanCurated	In ENVO ice cap is a type of ice mass; while in SWEET it is a realm. The notion of realm in SWEET and the way it's subclassed indicates that its top-level semantics need revision. An ice cap is not a realm, but part of a realm (probably). 
ENVO:00000299	ice field	soreac:IceField	ice field	skos:relatedMatch	HumanCurated	In SWEET ice field is sea ice; whereas in ENVO an ice cap is just a planetary body part

ENVO:01001551	ice lead	soreac:Lead	lead	skos:relatedMatch	HumanCurated	In SWEET a lead is a water substance while in ENVO it is a layer (SWEET appears to confound composition and morphology) - also SWEET restricts leads to sea ice; while there are clearly leads in navigatable fresh water (e.g., great lakes) - SWEET issue needed
ENVO:01000915	ice loss process	sophsy:Loss	loss	skos:broadMatch	HumanCurated	A phenomenon in SWEEt and a process in ENVO.
ENVO:03400005	ice pellet	sophatmopc:IcePellet	ice pellet	skos:relatedMatch	HumanCurated	Within SWEET this is subclassed to both ice (a material) and atmospheric precipitation which is a process. If this were just a material it woud be a candidate exact match to ENVO, however having both parents makes this mapping ambiguous.

ENVO:01000882	icestorm	sophatmopc:IceStorm	ice storm	skos:relatedMatch	HumanCurated	In ENVO this is a process while in SWEET it is a type of Atmospheric precipitation which is a phenomenon (which is ambiguous). The relations between the two term's superclass is what leads us to say related instead of close.
ENVO:00000542	kame	sorealg:Kame	kame	skos:relatedMatch	HumanCurated	In SWEET a kame is a glacial landform - a type of geometrical object; in ENVO a kame is a kind of material entity.
ENVO:03400007	lake-effect snow storm	sophatmopc:LakeEffectSnowstorm	lake effect snowstorm	skos:closeMatch	HumanCurated	Candidate Exact match. SWEET needs a definition and depending on what that becomes this could become exact match
ENVO:03400006	lake-effect snowfall	sophatmopc:LakeEffectSnow	lake effect snow	skos:closeMatch	HumanCurated	Candidate Exact match. In SWEET there is a long comment which should be turned into a definition.  SWEET talks about snow bands not the snow itself.

ENVO:01000981	mass liquid flow	sophfd:Flow	flow	skos:broadMatch	HumanCurated	SWEET terms is broader as it includes all flows e.g. energy
ENVO:01000981	mass liquid flow	sophsy:Flow	flow	skos:broadMatch	HumanCurated	Assuming subclasses of change in SWEET are processes (BFO process) but some terms in the hierarchy are debatable
ENVO:01000690	mass wasting	sophgg:MassWasting	mass wasting	skos:closeMatch	HumanCurated	SWEET hierarchy looks to be a process like in ENVO's. A candidate for exact match if SWEET adds ENVO's definition to SWEET's term.
ENVO:01000696	mass wasting flow	sophgg:MassWasting	mass wasting	skos:broadMatch	HumanCurated	ENVO term's parent is close match.
ENVO:03000009	material accumulation process	sophsy:Accumulation	accumulation	skos:relatedMatch	HumanCurated	The ENVO term is a process; while in SWEETs system phenomena covers several things quality or process.
ENVO:03000010	material transport process	sophft:Transport	transport	skos:relatedMatch	HumanCurated	Relationship is unclear. The SWEET hierarchy doesn't specify what's transported can't tell if it's material or not.

ENVO:00000181	nunatak	sorealo:Summit	summit	skos:broadMatch	HumanCurated	In SWEET these are geospatial entities, not physical entities; so at best a broader match.
ENVO:00000181	nunatak	sorepsg:Peak	peak	skos:broadMatch	HumanCurated	In SWEET these are geospatial entities, not physical entities; so at best a broader match.
ENVO:01001556	pack ice mass	soreac:PackIce	pack ice	skos:closeMatch	HumanCurated	A candidate for exact match if SWEET adds ENVO's definition to SWEET's term
ENVO:01001659	periglacial process	sophcr:Periglacial	periglacial	skos:closeMatch	HumanCurated	SWEET lacks a definition but based on its position in the phenomenon branch rather than the quality ENVO:01001853
ENVO:00000134	permafrost	soreas:Permafrost	permafrost	skos:relatedMatch	HumanCurated	In SWEET this is a 3-D geospatial entity, instead of ENVO's environmental material.
ENVO:03000144	planetary cryosphere	sorea:Cryosphere	cryosphere	skos:broadMatch	HumanCurated	In SWEET the parent class is a realm, while in ENVO it is an astronomical body part, so the SWEET term is broader than the ENVO term.
