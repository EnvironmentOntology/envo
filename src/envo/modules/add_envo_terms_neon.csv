ENVO:03600088,pool,'liquid astronomical body part',"A liquid astronomical body part which is in a river or stream created by local scour or impoundment and having a structural control. Pool water depth is above average, if all the running water in the stream was shut off, areas in the stream that would still hold water are pools. Pool water velocity is below average for the reach, causing fine sediments to deposit in pools. Pools are generally longer than they are wide (unless they are plunge pools), and are 1.5 x deeper at their maximum depth than they are at their crest.",stream,https://data.neonscience.org/documents/10179/2093436/NEON.DOC.003044vD/6d60d722-b43e-4654-bca3-524527771e66,,,,,,,,,,,2023-08-25T:17:42.901Z,0000-0002-5004-3362

ENVO:03600090,step pool,'liquid astronomical body part',"A liquid astronomical body part which has high‐gradient streams (steep) where water cascades over a rock or woody snag, dropping into a pool. Due to the gradient and surrounding geology, this pattern continues down the stream step (drop)—pool—step—pool—etc.",stream,https://data.neonscience.org/documents/10179/2093436/NEON.DOC.003044vD/6d60d722-b43e-4654-bca3-524527771e66,,,,,,,,,,,2023-08-25T:17:42.901Z,0000-0002-5004-3362
