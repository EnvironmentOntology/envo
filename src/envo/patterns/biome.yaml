description: >-

  A biome is an ecosystem that participates in some climactic ecological succession, ie it is resilient to perturbations
  It should be possible to infer that class with "biome" in its label should be classified as a 'biome'.
  Does this pattern generate biomes from all ecosystems, or does it check the patterns of classes that are already present?
