description: >-
  This template is for representing biome classes, where a biome is an ecosystem that participates in some climactic ecological succession
  (i.e. it is resilient to perturbations).
  Biome classes are defined by refining a more general "ecosystem" class and adding a climactic succession differentia.
  When creating a new biome class, there must be an existing ecosystem class, where that ecosystem class is defined
  by the ecosystem template.

  For example, the class "desert biome" is defined in terms of "desert ecosystem", and "desert ecosystem" is defined in terms
  of deserts.
