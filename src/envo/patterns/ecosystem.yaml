  An ecosystem is any environmental system which has both biotic and abiotic parts. 
  Ecosystems are typically defined by some entity that "determines" them. For example, 
  a desert ecosystem is determined by the presence of a desert - if the desert wasn't there, 
  it wouldn't be a desert ecosystem.
