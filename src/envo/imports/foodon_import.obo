comment: The FoodOn "food product" class is provided as a branch under which new food product categories and food products themselves can be placed. Here classes are provided to differentiate a food product by its food composition, processing and/or consumption characteristics. This avoids brand name products but it may include generic food dish categories. It has a much greater depth and polyhierarchy than other agency product type schemes have in an effort to group related products together.  The upper level basis of this tree originated in the environment ontology (ENVO) and from the US Code of Federal Regulations.

Some herbal teas on the market today include probiotic cultures alongside tea leaves to maintain gut health but the tea itself hasn't been fermented. Most dried teas however don't use live cultures at all during production. Instead, harvested tea leaves undergo a natural chemical process known as oxidation, which also changes the color, flavor and level of health benefits in the resulting brew."

Plants in this genus are commonly referred to as yam bean, although the term \"yam bean\" can be another name for jícama.\n\nIn contrast to the root, the remainder of the jícama plant is very poisonous; the seeds contain the toxin rotenone, which is used to poison insects and fish.\n\nFAO: The yam bean is a legume but unlike its close relatives the soybean and other beans, the yam bean is cultivated for its large, tuberous roots."

comment: This term was renamed from "food product by quality" to align better with COB "characteristic" label, and as well to disambiguate from other use of "quality" as a food grading. This term is useful for tasks like food inspection where little prior knowledge of how the food came to be is available. Some terms like "food (frozen)" are both a quality descriptor and the output of a process.

It was first adopted by the 18th Session of the Codex Alimentarius Commission, (1989).\n\nThe Codex Classification includes food commodities and animal feedstuffs for which Codex maximum residue limits will not necessarily be established. The Classification is intended to be as complete a listing of food commodities in trade as possible, classified into groups on the basis of the commodity's similar potential for pesticide residues.\n\nThe Classification may also be appropriate for other purposes such as setting maximum levels for other types of residues or for other contaminants in food. The Codex Classification should be consulted in order to obtain a precise description of the food or animal feed commodities and, especially, in cases where Codex maximum residue limits have been set for groups of food and groups of animal feedstuffs. The Codex Classification is intended to promote harmonization of the terms used to describe commodities which are subject to maximum residue limits and of the approach to grouping commodities with similar potential for residue for which a common group maximum residue limit can be set."
