comment: The epidermis can be composed of one or more layers of cells.

comment: Roots function in the absorption of water and inorganic nutrients, anchoring the plant body to the substrate and supporting it, storage of food and nutrients, and vegetative reproduction. The roots of most vascular plant species enter into symbiosis with soil-borne microorganisms. Roots are usually positively geotropic and found underground, although there are many exceptions such as the aerial roots of orchids. Roots often form secondary thickening from the root lateral meristem (PO:0006308). Commonly thought of as one of the three basic parts of the plant body, along with the shoot axis (PO:0025029) and leaves (PO:0025034).

comment: The shoot system is generally used to refer to the above-ground plant parts, although some plants have parts of their shoot system underground. For example, a rhizome (PO:0004542), bulb (PO:0025356), a corm (PO:0025355) or a subterranean tuber (PO:0004547), as in Solanum tuberosum (potato) or yam, are all part of the shoot system.
