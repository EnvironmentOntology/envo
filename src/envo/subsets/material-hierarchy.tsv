Petroplinthite is a continuous, fractured or broken sheet of connected, strongly cemented to indurated nodules or mottles. Pisoliths are discrete strongly cemented to indurated nodules. Both petroplinthite and pisoliths develop from plinthite by hardening.

ENVO:00002253	umbrisol	ENVO:00001998	soil			Umbrisols are soils in which organic matter has accumulated within the mineral surface soil (in most cases with low base saturation) to the extent that it significantly affects the behaviour and utilization of the soil.
ENVO:00002254	vertisol	ENVO:00001998	soil			A soil in which there is a high content of expansive clay known as montmorillonite that forms deep cracks in drier seasons or years. Alternate shrinking and swelling causes self-mulching, where the soil material consistently mixes itself, causing vertisols to have an extremely deep A horizon and no B horizon.
ENVO:00002255	solonetz	ENVO:00001998	soil			Solonetz are soils with a dense, strongly structured, clayey subsurface horizon that has a high proportion of adsorbed Na and/or Mg ions. Solonetz that contain free soda (Na2CO3) are strongly alkaline (field pH > 8.5).
ENVO:00002256	regosol	ENVO:00001998	soil			Regosols form a taxonomic remnant group containing all soils that could not be accommodated in any of the other RSGs. In practice, Regosols are very weakly developed mineral soils in unconsolidated materials that do not have a mollic or umbric horizon, are not very shallow or very rich in gravels (Leptosols), sandy (Arenosols) or with fluvic materials (Fluvisols). Regosols are extensive in eroding lands, particularly in arid and semi-arid areas and in mountainous terrain.

ENVO:00002275	technosol	ENVO:00001998	soil			Technosols are soils whose properties and pedogenesis are dominated by their technical origin. They contain a significant amount of artefacts (something in the soil recognizably made or extracted from the earth by humans), or are sealed by technic hard rock (material created by humans, having properties unlike natural rock).

The Codex Classification of food and animal feed commodities moving in trade and the description of the various items and groups of food and animal feedstuffs included in the present document have been developed by the Codex Committee on Pesticide Residues. It was first adopted by the 18th Session of the Codex Alimentarius Commission, (1989).

The Codex Classification includes food commodities and animal feedstuffs for which Codex maximum residue limits will not necessarily be established. The Classification is intended to be as complete a listing of food commodities in trade as possible, classified into groups on the basis of the commodity's similar potential for pesticide residues.

The Classification may also be appropriate for other purposes such as setting maximum levels for other types of residues or for other contaminants in food. The Codex Classification should be consulted in order to obtain a precise description of the food or animal feed commodities and, especially, in cases where Codex maximum residue limits have been set for groups of food and groups of animal feedstuffs. The Codex Classification is intended to promote harmonization of the terms used to describe commodities which are subject to maximum residue limits and of the approach to grouping commodities with similar potential for residue for which a common group maximum residue limit can be set."

FOODON:03420108	sugar	FOODON:03420152	carbohydrate extract, concentrate, or isolate			A broad term that includes the nutritive sweeteners dextrose, fructose, galactose, lactose, maltose and sucrose, which are simple carbohydrates with molecules composed of one or two saccharide units. Note that on a product label or in a recipe, 'sugar' means *SUCROSE* and should be so indexed. Use the broad term *SUGAR* only if the specific sugar used is not known or not listed in the vocabulary.
FOODON:03420152	carbohydrate extract, concentrate, or isolate	FOODON:03420228	extract, concentrate or isolate of plant or animal			Extract, concentrate or isolate high in sugar, oligosaccharide or polysaccharide.
FOODON:03420156	brown sugar	FOODON:00001083|FOODON:03301073	sugar (granulated)|sugar condiment			Soft sugar whose crystals are covered by a film of refined dark syrup that imparts color, flavor, and moisture.
FOODON:03420228	extract, concentrate or isolate of plant or animal	FOODON:00001714	food product component			A physical-chemical component separated from the food source or its parts by extraction, centrifugation, filtration, heat processing, expressing or a similar process. The separated component may be converted through further processing. If this is done, the final substance is indexed. A water-extracted component may remain in aqueous dispersion. The extract, concentrate or isolate is indexed in preference to the anatomic part from which it is derived. For example, peanut oil is indexed under *PEANUT* combined wih *FAT OR OIL* rather than with *SEED OR KERNEL*. On the other hand, fruit and vegetable juices can be indexed under *FRUIT JUICE OR NECTAR* or *VEGETABLE JUICE* (A. PRODUCT TYPE); therefore the anatomic part of the plant should be indexed.
FOODON:03420244	mammalian milk whey	FOODON:03315150	mammalian milk product	whey		The serum or watery part of milk that is separated from the thicker or more coagulable part or curd, espcially in the process of making cheese; it contains lactose, minerals and lactalbumin.

FOODON:03430109	food (liquid, low viscosity)	FOODON:03430130	food (liquid)			A liquid that flows very easily at room temperature. Examples are: water, apple juice, sherry, acidophilus milk, whipping cream and some heavy liqueurs. The range of low viscosity liquid spans sucrose solutions between 0 and 45% solids (viscosity range from 1 to 10 centipoise). Prefer 'solid pieces' factor term to 'small particles' if both appear in the food.
FOODON:03430130	food (liquid)	FOODON:00002454	food product by quality			A state of matter between a solid and a gas, in which a substance has the capacity to flow and conforms to the shape of the container. Liquids range from water to honey, corresponding to a range in viscosity (or apparent viscosity) from 1 to 500 centipoise (viscosity is a measure of a liquid's resistance to flow). Products that are pourable but have a higher viscosity are *SEMILIQUID*.
