TARGET DEFINITION: A large area of brine on the ocean basin near cold seep vents which release methane into the water. These pools are concentrations of water having an extremely high salinity as compared to the surrounding ocean, caused by the motion of large salt deposits through salt tectonics.
--------------------
SOURCE DEFINITION: Marine brine pools are large areas of brine on the ocean basin. These pools are bodies of water that have a salinity three to five times greater than the surrounding ocean. For deep-sea brine pools the source of the salt is the dissolution of large salt deposits through salt tectonics. The brine often contains high concentrations of methane, providing energy to chemosynthetic animals that live near the pool."

ENVO:03000102	glacial sintering	A sintering process during which snow is compacted into glacial ice.
ENVO:03000103	aeolian transport of snow	An aeolian transport process during which powdery snow is displaced and moved.
ENVO:03000104	snow drift formation	An accumulation process during which a powdery snow carried on the wind settles on a solid surface, forming a mound.
ENVO:03000105	slab avalanche	A mass wasting process during which slab snow rapidly moves down a sloping surface.
ENVO:03000106	powdery snow avalanche	An avalanche during which powdery snow rapidly flows down a sloping surface.
ENVO:03000107	wet snow avalanche	An avalanche during which a suspension of water and snow flows down a sloping surface.
ENVO:03000108	slab snow	Snow which is cohesive, hard and overlies weaker snow.
ENVO:03000110	cryoform	A geographic feature which is primarily composed of a continuous mass of snow and/or ice.
ENVO:03000111	snow mass	A mass of snow.
ENVO:03000112	snow drift	An accumulation of powdery snow which was transported and deposited via a snow drifting process.
ENVO:03000113	snow patch	An accumulation of snow and firn which rests upon land.
ENVO:03000114	seasonal snow patch	A snow patch which forms during a cold season and melts away during the succeeding warm season.
ENVO:03000115	perennial snow patch	A snow patch which persists through at least one seasonal cycle.
ENVO:03000116	snowpack	A layer which consists of an accumulation of snow.
ENVO:03000117	channel	A structure which traverses a mass of one or more environmental materials, and encloses a roughly tubular site.
ENVO:03000118	atmosphere and water column exposed melt pond	A melt pond which and is exposed to the atmosphere and to a lesser degree water underlying the ice mass which contains it.
ENVO:03000119	water column exposed melt pond	A melt pond which is formed close to that part of an ice mass which is in contact with some underlying water body, and which has channels connecting it to that water body.
ENVO:03000120	subglacial lake	A lake which is situated beneath a glacier.
ENVO:03000121	erosion through nivation	An erosion process during which rock or soil is removed or degraded due to alternative thawing and freezing of meltwater beneath and at the margins of snowbanks.
ENVO:04000000	adfreezing	Adfreezing is a freezing process during which two objects adhere to each other via ice.
ENVO:04000001	frost heaving process	Frost heaving is a process during which an upwards swelling of soil occurs due to freezing conditions caused by an increasing presence of ice as it grows towards the surface.
ENVO:04000009	active permafrost layer	A layer which is composed of ground that is 1) subject to annual thawing and freezing and 2) present in areas underlain by permafrost.
ENVO:2000004	algal bloom	A feature that arises from a rapid increase or accumulation in the population of algae (typically microscopic) in an aquatic system.
ENVO:2000005	freshwater algal bloom	An algal bloom that is located in freshwater. Freshwater algal blooms are the result of an excess of nutrients, particularly some phosphates.
ENVO:3400001	area of alpine tundra	An area of tundra which is present in a region subject to alpine conditions.
