ENVO:01000004	concentration basin mediterranean sea biome	ENVO:01000047	mediterranean sea biome			The concentration basin mediterranean sea biome comprises expressions of the mediterranean sea biome that have higher salinity than bordering oceans due to evaporation. Water exchange consists of inflow of the fresher oceanic water in the upper layer and outflow of the saltier mediterranean water in the lower layer of the connecting channel.
ENVO:01000020	estuarine biome	ENVO:00000447	marine biome			Expressions of the estuarine biome occur at wide lower courses of a rivers where they flow into a sea. Estuaries experience tidal flows and their water is a changing mixture of fresh and salt.
ENVO:01000022	marine salt marsh biome	ENVO:00000447	marine biome			The marine salt marsh biome comprises marshes that are transitional intertidals between land and salty or brackish marine water (e.g.: sloughs, bays, estuaries). It is dominated by halophytic (salt tolerant) herbaceous plants. The daily tidal surges bring in nutrients, which tend to settle in roots of the plants within the salt marsh. The natural chemical activity of salty (or brackish) water and the tendency of algae to bloom in the shallow unshaded water also allow for great biodiversity.
ENVO:01000023	marine pelagic biome	ENVO:00000447	marine biome		envoPolar	The marine pelagic biome (pelagic meaning open sea) is that of the marine water column, from the surface to the greatest depths.

It is the boundary layer where all exchange occurs between the atmosphere and the ocean. The chemical, physical, and biological properties of the SML differ greatly from the sub-surface water just a few centimeters beneath.
ENVO:01000035	oceanic epipelagic zone biome	ENVO:01000033	oceanic pelagic zone biome			The oceanic epipelagic zone biome comprises regions of the marine water column that occur offshore, beyond a continental shelf. This biome extends from the surface of the ocean to a depth of ca. 200-250m.

ENVO:01000038	oceanic abyssopelagic zone biome	ENVO:01000033	oceanic pelagic zone biome			The abyssopelagic zone biome comprises the marine water column below the bathypelagic zone biome at approximately 2500 -2700 m and extends either to the hadal pelagic zone biome (at approximately 6000 m) or to the benthopelagic zone biome within ca. 100 m of the seafloor. The depth of 2700 m may be critical for physiological reasons as the change in hydrostatic pressure across this depth may preclude organism migration.
ENVO:01000039	oceanic hadal pelagic zone biome	ENVO:01000033	oceanic pelagic zone biome			The oceanic hadal pelagic zone biome comprises the water column in oceanic trenches occurring at depths between 6000m and 10,000m.

A general reversal in the declining gradient of pelagic biomass may be observed here, perhaps explained by viable nutrition on the sea floor being resuspended by bottom currents. This zone typically extends 100 m above the seafloor, but may reach upto1000 m during benthic storms.
ENVO:01000041	neritic sea surface microlayer biome	ENVO:01000032	neritic pelagic zone biome			The neritic sea surface microlayer (SML) biome comprises the top 1000 micrometers of marine surface waters occurring above a continental shelf.

The epipelagic zone encompasses the euphotic zone and, where and when it occurs, the seasonal thermocline.
ENVO:01000043	neritic mesopelagic zone biome	ENVO:01000032	neritic pelagic zone biome			The neritic mesopelagic zone biome comprises the marine column that occurs above a continental shelf and extends from approximately 200 to 1000 m depth - the maximal depth of light penetration in all but the clearest oligotrophic ocean regions. In comparison to the epipelagic zone, dominant forms of pelagic organisms do not change very much; however, there are marked changes in species composition and the proportion of smaller-sized individuals decreases.

The Earth's mantle is composed of ultramafic rocks.
ENVO:01000054	marine basaltic hydrothermal vent biome	ENVO:01000030	marine hydrothermal vent biome			A marine basaltic hydrothermal vent biome comprises regions of the marine hydrothermal vent biome hosted on basaltic rocks.
