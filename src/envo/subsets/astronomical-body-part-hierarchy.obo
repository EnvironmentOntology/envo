comment: The term body of water most often refers to large accumulations of water, such as oceans, seas, and lakes, but it includes smaller pools of water such as ponds, wetlands, or more rarely, puddles. A body of water does not have to be still or contained; Rivers, streams, canals, and other geographical features where water moves from one place to another are also considered bodies of water.

comment: A mountain is generally steeper than a hill, but there is no universally accepted standard definition for the height of a mountain or a hill although a mountain usually has an identifiable summit. The USGS had previously defined mountains as localised elevations of more than 300 meters; however, the organisation has accepted there are no technical definitions in the US. In ENVO, we primarily use the UNEP-WCMC classification to be compliant with SDG monitoring, but we can host other classifications on request: http://www.fao.org/sustainable-development-goals/indicators/1542/en/

comment: The definitions of forest can vary greatly, and different classes will be needed to support the major categories. Tree cover alone is not enough to distinguish between forests and plantations. The international definition proposed by the 2010 FAO Forestry Resource Assessment: "land spanning more than 0.5 ha with trees higher than 5 metres and canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ . It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use." - FAO.  2010. Global forest resources assessment 2010, Main report, FAO Forestry Paper 163. Rome.

The depth contours, the shoreline and other movements influence the direction and strength of the movements of water that forms a given current." [BS:bs]

They are typically composed of sand, although could be of any granular matter that the moving water has access to and is capable of shifting around (for example, soil, silt, gravel, cobble, shingle, or even boulders). The grain size of the material comprising a bar is related: to the size of the waves or the strength of the currents moving the material, but the availability of material to be worked by waves and currents is also important."

comment: Savannas are intermediate grassland-woodland ecosystems, with some instances having almost no trees and others having trees at densities higher than some forests. Savannas are typically subject to tropical or subtropical climatic conditions. Savannas typically have seasonal water availability and grass, sedge (Cyperaceae) or  rush (Juncaceae) communities.

def: "A deposition landform found off coasts. A spit is a type of bar or beach that develops where a re-entrant occurs, such as at a cove, bay, ria, or river mouth.

Where the direction of the shore turns inland (reenters) the longshore current spreads out or dissipates. No longer able to carry the full load, much of the sediment is dropped. This causes a bar to build out from the shore, eventually becoming a spit." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spit_%28landform%29]

For deep-sea brine pools the source of the salt is the dissolution of large salt deposits through salt tectonics. The brine often contains high concentrations of methane, providing energy to chemosynthetic animals that live near the pool." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brine_pool]

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_shelf, https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4808-4736]
comment: An ice shelf may grow hundreds of miles out to sea.  Usually of great horizontal extent and with a level or gently undulating surface. Nourished by annual snow accumulation and also by the seaward extension of land glaciers. Limited areas may be aground. Ice shelves are much thicker than sea ice often filling embayments in the coastline of an ice sheet.. Currently, nearly all ice shelves are in Antarctica, where most of the ice discharged into the ocean flows via ice shelves. The mass balance of an ice shelf may have significant components of both gain and loss at the base. The seaward edge is termed an ice front.  The calving of an ice shelf forms tabular icebergs and ice islands. {xref="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4808-4736"}

comment: In this definition, there is an assumption that no major perturbations are occurring or have occurred in a time frame affects the successional dynamics of the ecosystem. A "major" perturbation is one which disrupts the community's ability to restore its (near) equilibrium. Usually, pioneer or early secondary successional processes would be in effect in such scenarios.

The sharp-edged boulders carried at the bottom of the glacier erode the softer rock more quickly by abrasion, thus creating a hollow called a rock basin. On either side of the rock basin, the more resistant rock is eroded less and these outcrops of harder rock are known as rock bars, which act as dams between which rainwater may accumulate after the retreat of the ice age, filling up the rock basin and creating a ribbon lake. A ribbon lake may also form behind a terminal or recessional moraine, both of which also act as dams, enabling water to accumulate behind them. A ribbon lake may also occur if a tributary glacier joins a main glacier. The increase in power can create a trough, which is filled with water from a river/meltwater to create a ribbon lake."

def: "A sea surface layer which is 1) not covered by ice and 2) laterally surrounded by either pack ice or land and pack ice." [https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4808-4736]
comment: A polynya is a Russian term for any non-linear shaped area of open water within the ice pack. Polynyas may contain brash ice and/or be covered with new ice, nilas or young ice; submariners refer to these as skylights.\n\nSometimes the polynya is limited on one side by the coast and is called a shore polynya or by fast ice and is called a flaw polynya. If it recurs in the same position every year, e.g. off the mouths of big rivers, it is called a recurring polynya. A temporary small clearing in pack ice which consists of small floes and brash in continuous local movement is called an unstable polynya; an opening which is flanked by large floes and therefore appears to be relatively stable is called a stable polynya.\n\nPolynyas range in size from relatively small to enormous. The largest polynya observed in the Antarctic was the Weddell Polynya of 1975-77, covering an area of 2x105km2.\n\nThe two main categories of polynya are sensible heat and latent heat, depending on the mechanism responsible for maintaining their presence. Latent heat polynyas are maintained by persistent katabatic winds that drain off the continent. Newly formed ice is advected away by the wind, leaving the surface ice-free and open to more ice formation. In this manner latent heat polynyas can be major sources of new ice production. Coastal polynyas are primarily of this type. Sensible heat polynyas are maintained by upwelling warm water that supplies a sufficiently large oceanic heat flux to the base of the ice to reduce its thickness, or melt it completely. These polynyas are not responsible for large quantities of new ice production. A polynya may also form by a combination of the sensible and latent heat processes.\n\n\nFrom the remote sensing/sea ice standpoint a polynya is a hole in the ice that ordinarily wouldn't be there - except that either the wind is creating it by pushing the ice away or there is something under the ice that is warmer than its surroundings and melting the ice that would otherwise be there. {xref="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4808-4736"}
comment: Could be a subclass of a class that describes holes in solid material covering water or other liquids. Perhaps a class like "clearing". Logical def can include surrounded_by "ice mass".

def: "A frost heave which is formed as the result of a perennial ice lens forming under soil, pushing a roughly oval portion land surface upwards." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palsa]
comment: Palsas typically occur in areas with discontinuous permafrost, frequently peat bogs. A palsa consists, similarly to a pingo, of an ice core and overlying soil materials, in case of a palsa usually boggy soil. Palsas are characteristically found in areas with discontinuous permafrost and in such areas bay be the only reliable surface evidence of permafrost. A palsa needs large quantities of water for the formation of its ice core (i.e. ice lens), which is why they frequently emerge from and are bound by boggy soils, which can store enormous quantities of water in their pores. Palsas develop particularly in moorlands and are therefore also named palsamoors.

def: "An environmental material which is primarily composed of minerals, varying proportions of sand, silt, and clay, organic material such as humus, interstitial gases, liquids, and a broad range of resident micro- and macroorganisms." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil]
comment: 'In engineering terms, soil is referred to as regolith, or loose rock material that lies above the 'solid geology'. Soil is commonly referred to as "earth" or "dirt"; technically, the term "dirt" should be restricted to displaced soil.' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil\n\n" The upper limit of soil is the boundary between soil and air, shallow water, live plants, or plant materials that have not begun to decompose. Areas are not considered to have soil if the surface is permanently covered by water too deep (typically more than 2.5 meters) for the growth of rooted plants.\n\nThe lower boundary that separates soil from the nonsoil underneath is most difficult to define. Soil consists of horizons near the Earth's surface that, in contrast to the underlying parent material, have been altered by the interactions of climate, relief, and living organisms over time. Commonly, soil grades at its lower boundary to hard rock or to earthy materials virtually devoid of animals, roots, or other marks of biological activity. For purposes of classification, the lower boundary of soil is arbitrarily set at 200 cm."

Liming often improves plant growth and increases the activity of soil bacteria, but oversupply may result in harm to plant life.\nLiming can also improve aggregate stability on clay soils. For this purpose structure lime, products containing calcium oxide (CaO) or hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) in mixes with calcium carbonate (CaCO3), are often used. Structure liming can reduce losses of clay and nutrients from soil aggregates. {xref="Liming:(soil)"}

comment: Red soil typically derives from crystalline rock in warm, temperate, moist climates under deciduous or mixed forest. It has thin organic and organic-mineral layers, a black brown leached layer resting on an illuvium red layer. The majority of red soils have a loamy texture. Their chemical composition varies across regions, but often includes non-soluble material 90.47%, iron 3.61%, aluminium 2.92%, organic matter 1.01%, magnesium 0.70%, lime 0.56%, carbon dioxide 0.30%, potash 0.24%, soda 0.12%, phosphorus 0.09% and nitrogen 0.08%. \n\nOn the uplands, they are thin, poor and gravelly, sandy, or stony and porous, light-colored soils on which food crops like bajra can be grown. In contrast, on the lower plains and valleys they are rich, deep, dark colored fertile loam on which, under irrigation, can produce excellent crops like cotton, wheat, pulses, tobacco, jowar, linseed, millet, potatoes and fruits. {xref="Red:soil"}

def: "MERGED DEFINITION:\nTARGET DEFINITION: An oceanographic feature that involves wind-driven motion of dense, cooler, and usually nutrient-rich water towards the ocean surface, replacing the warmer, usually nutrient-deplete surface water.\n--------------------\nSOURCE DEFINITION: A marine upwelling is a net flow of marine water to the surface of the water column from deeper regions. This is often a result of surface water displacement off continental coasts by wind action. Localised upwellings may also occur along divergent fronts around eddies and along some of the major oceanographic features. Deeper waters often have higher nutrient content; consequently blooms of primary producers, such as planktonic algae, are generally observed around upwelling zones."

def: "A marine Taylor column is a Taylor column that is formed in a marine body of water. Currents flowing over shoaling topography such as seamounts are accelerated and destabilised, resulting in Taylor columns. Eddies and internal waves are generated downstream of the topological feature and may extend 1000 m or so above them. This may result in a localised increase in primary production where the Taylor column reaches surface waters."

def: "A marine current bordered by the surface of the water column and the permanent thermocline, where it occurs. Surface currents are mostly wind driven and mostly limited to the top 400 m of the water column. Ocean currents are driven by the circulation of wind above surface waters. Frictional stress at the interface between the ocean and the wind causes the water to move in the direction of the wind. Large ocean currents are a response of the atmosphere and ocean to the flow of energy from the tropics to polar regions. In some cases, currents are transient features and affect only a small area. Other ocean currents are essentially permanent and extend over large horizontal distances."

comment: ENVO contains this top-level class, but all instances will be in GAZ. The definition is preliminary and will be aligned to BFO.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/  Ecozones correspond to the floristic kingdoms of botany or zoogeographic regions of zoology. Ecozones are characterized by the evolutionary history of the organisms they contain. They are distinct from biomes, also known as major habitat types, which are divisions of the Earth's surface based on life form, or the adaptation of plants and animals to climatic, soil, and other conditions. Biomes are characterized by similar climax vegetation. Each ecozone may include a number of different biomes. A tropical moist broadleaf forest in Central America, for example, may be similar to one in New Guinea in its vegetation type and structure, climate, soils, etc., but these forests are inhabited by plants and animals with very different evolutionary histories.

comment: This variant of the desert climate is somewhat rare outside of Asia. A cold desert climate is typically found in temperate zones, almost always in the rain shadow of high mountains which restrict precipitation from the westerly winds, or in the case of Central Asia, from the monsoon. The Gobi desert in Mongolia is a classic example of a region with a cold desert climate. Though hot in summer, it shares the very cold winters of the rest of Central Asia. The Kyzyl Kum and Taklamakan deserts of Central Asia and the drier portions of the Great Basin Desert of the western United States are other major examples of BWk climates. The Ladakh region, lying in the Great Himalayas in India also has a cold desert climate.

def: "A wet meadow is a type of wetland with soils that are saturated with water for part or all of the growing season." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_meadow]
comment: Debate exists whether a wet meadow is a type of marsh or a completely separate type of wetland. Wet prairies and wet savannas are hydrologically similar. Wet meadows may occur because of restricted drainage or the receipt of large amounts of water from rain or melted snow. They may also occur in riparian zones and around the shores of large lakes. Unlike a marsh or swamp, a wet meadow does not have standing water present except for brief to moderate periods during the growing season. Instead, the ground in a wet meadow fluctuates between brief periods of inundation and longer periods of saturation. Wet meadows often have large numbers of wetland plant species, which frequently survive as buried seeds during dry periods, and then regenerate after flooding. Wet meadows therefore do not usually support aquatic life such as fish. They typically have a high diversity of plant species, and may attract large numbers of birds, small mammals and insects including butterflies. {xref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_meadow"}

comment: Material parts of astronomical bodies generally have boundaries formed by discontinuities in qualities, composition, or other physical characterisitcs. These boundaries are sometimes sharp, and sometimes diffuse, with different classification systems and communities declaring varying thresholds (e.g. for where a shoreline, forest, or other entity begins and ends). However, some boundaries are declared by fiat - that is, by arbitrary human convention or decree - particularly by regulatory or other authorities and communities of practice. The classes in this hierarchy attempt to offer generalisable definitions that allow multiple classfiication systems to map to and interoperate through. If desired, we can create classes that declare thresholds used by a given authority or community under the more generic ones, annotated with source information.

comment: The definitions of forest can vary greatly, and different classes will be needed to support the major categories. Tree cover alone is not enough to distinguish between forests and plantations.

It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use." - FAO.  2010. Global forest resources assessment 2010, Main report, FAO Forestry Paper 163. Rome.

CMECS provides the following notes: "Commonly found on intertidal mud flats along the shores of estuaries. Tidal mangrove shrublands may include immature stands or stunted mature trees that indicate a harsh growing environment. Areas characterized by tall mangroves (> 6 meters) are placed in the Tidal Mangrove Forest Biotic Group. Where tidal amplitude is relatively low, the vegetation forms narrow bands along the coastal plains, and it rarely penetrates inland more than several kilometers along rivers. Where tidal amplitude is greater, mangroves extend further inland along river courses, forming extensive stands in the major river deltas. Also, mangrove cays may occur within the lagoon complex of barrier reefs. The list of biotic communities for this group is long: a few examples are provided below, and the complete list is available in Appendix F"

comment: When present in aggregates, individual cirrocumulus clouds are merged or separate, and regularly arranged in a thin patch, sheet or layer. Most of the small structural elements have an apparent width of less than one degree. Strongly supercooled water droplets may occur but are usually rapidly replaced by ice crystals. When well-illuminated by sunlight (excluding during sunrise and sunset) cirrocumulus clouds appear white. Absence of any precipitation.

comment: Cirrostratus clouds totally or partly cover the sky and are always thin enough to show the disc of the local star. When well-illuminated by sunlight (excluding during sunrise and sunset) cirrostratus clouds appear transparent or whitish. Cirrostratus clouds generally produce halo phenomena; sometimes the veil of cirrostratus is so thin that a halo provides the only indication of its presence. Absence of any precipitation.

comment: Prior to approximately 2014, drift ice was synonymous with the various grades of pack ice, described as very open (with an ice concentration of 1/10 to 3/10), open (4/10 to 6/10, with many leads and polynyas and the floes generally not in contact with one another), close (7/10 to 8/10, composed of floes mostly in contact), very close (9/10 to less than 10/10), and compact (10/10, with no water visible, called consolidated pack ice if the floes are frozen together). This is deprecated, with pack ice now referring to drift ice with a concentration equal to or above 7/10; however, other usages are still common.

comment: Fast ice is central to the livelihoods of Arctic coastal communities who use it to access fishing and hunting grounds. Vertical fluctuations may be observed during changes of sea level. Fast ice may be formed on site from sea water or by freezing of pack ice of any age to the shore, and it may extend a few yards (meters) or several hundred miles (kilometers) from the coast. Fast ice may be more than one year old and may then be prefixed with appropriate age category (old, second- year, or multiyear). If it is thicker than about 7 ft (2 m) above sea level, it is called an ice shelf. {xref="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4808-4736"}

def: "An ice mass which has broken away from a larger ice mass on land, such as a glacier or ice shelf, and may be either afloat or aground." [https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4808-4736]
comment: The greater part of an iceberg's mass (4/5 to 8/9) is below sea level, which makes them dangerous to shipping in high and mid-latitude regions of the ocean. The top of an ice berg usually protrudes more than 5 m above water-level and typically extends from tens of meters to many tens of kilometres across. Icebergs may be described as tabular, dome-shaped, sloping, pinnacled, dry-docked, blocky, weathered or glacier bergs in addition to having a size qualifier. Icebergs are not sea ice, when they melt they add fresh water to the ocean.  The unmodified term "iceberg" usually refers to the irregular masses of ice formed by the calving of glaciers along an orographically rough coast, whereas tabular icebergs and ice islands are calved from an ice shelf, while bergs formed from sea ice are called floebergs. In decreasing size, they are classified as: ice island (few thousand square meters to 500 km^2 in area); tabular iceberg; iceberg; bergy bit (less than 5 m above sea level, between 1 and 200 m^2 in area); and growler (less than 1 m above sea level, about 20 m^2 in area). Alaskan icebergs rarely exceed 500 feet in maximum dimension.  Antarctic icebergs originate from the ice mass of the Antarctic continent that has accumulated over many thousands of years. {xref="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4808-4736"}

comment: Land ice is any part of the Earth's seasonal or perennial ice cover that has formed over land as the result, principally, of the freezing of precipitation; opposed to sea ice formed by the freezing of seawater.  Thus, an iceberg or tabular iceberg is land ice as well as its parent glacier, ice sheet, or ice shelf. The two major concentrations of land ice are the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica. Glaciers and ice caps are the other important forms; however, some members of the glaciology community hold that glaciers (i.e. rock glaciers) need not have any ice. {xref="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4808-4736"}

In some cases, oceans themselves are considered landforms. Here, we have provided subclasses to resolve this ambiguity, but place oceans and other water bodies elsewhere.In later revisions, this hiearchy is likely to be reordered based on the formation processes of the entities within it.

comment: On Earth, such ecosystems typically comprise ecological communities adapted to temperatures above a monthly average of 18 degrees Celsius, high daily temperature ranges of approximately 20 degrees Celsius, high insolation (but lower than that of a tropical desert biome), inhibited cloud formation, and very low precipitation. Subtropical desert biomes located near coasts with cold upwellings may have cooler temperatures and reduced insolution due to fog

comment: Precipitation in the form of very small, white opaque particles of ice; the solid equivalent of drizzle. They resemble snow pellets in external appearance, but are more flattened and elongated, and generally have diameters of less than 1 mm; they neither shatter nor bounce when they hit a hard surface. Descriptions of the physical structure of snow grains vary widely and include very fine, simple ice crystals; tiny, complex snow crystals; small, compact bundles of rime; and particles with a rime core and a fine glaze coating. It is agreed that snow grains usually fall in very small quantities, mostly from stratus clouds or from fog, and never in the form of a shower. {xref="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4808-4736"}

name: cryosphere
def: "An astronomical body part which is composed primarily of environmental materials in their frozen form." [https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4808-4736]
comment: The term generally refers to the portions of the Earth where water is in solid form, including snow cover, floating ice, glaciers, ice caps, ice sheets, seasonally frozen ground and perennially frozen ground (permafrost). The Cryosphere may be divided into the cryoatmosphere, the cryohydrosphere (snow cover, glaciers, and river, lake and sea Ice) and the cryolithosphere (perennially and seasonally cryotic ground, rock glacier). Some definitions consider the cryosphere to include any area of Earth which is sufficiently cold for pure water to freeze for at least a part of each year. It should be noted that "Some authorities exclude the earth's atmosphere from the Earth's Cryosphere; others restrict the term Cryosphere to the regions of the earth's crust where Permafrost exists."\n\nDefinitions of Cryosphere come from several glossaries including:\n- PhysicalGeography.net http://physicalgeography.net/\n-  van Everdingen, Robert, ed., 2005 (1998 revised May 2005).

comment: They may be spherical, irregular, or (rarely) conical in shape. Ice pellets usually bounce when hitting hard ground and make a sound upon impact. They can fall as continuous precipitation or in showers. Now internationally recognized, ice pellets includes two basically different types of precipitation, known in the United States as 1) sleet or grains of ice, generally transparent, globular, solid grains of ice that have formed from the freezing of raindrops or the refreezing of largely melted snowflakes when falling through a below-freezing layer of air near the earth's surface; and 2) small hail, generally translucent particles, consisting of snow pellets encased in a thin layer of ice. The ice layer may form either by the accretion of droplets upon the snow pellet or by the melting and refreezing of the surface of the snow pellet. {xref="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4808-4736"}

comment: The pathogenicity that is suppressed is typically directed towards plants, especially crops. Soils are typically classified as pathogen-suppressive if a pathogen 1) cannot establish itself or persist, 2) is able to establish itself, but causes little or no damage, or 3) is able to establishe itself, but only causes disease that does not result in long-term harm.

comment: Pool water depth is above average for the stream. If if all the running water in the stream was shut off, areas in the stream that still hold water are pools. Pool water velocity is below average for the reach, causing fine sediments to deposit in pools. Pools are generally longer than they are wide (unless they are plunge pools), and are 1.5 x deeper at their maximum depth than they are at their crest
