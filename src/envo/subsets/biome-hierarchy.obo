def: "A biome is an ecosystem to which resident ecological communities have evolved adaptations." [DOI:10.1186/2041-1480-4-43, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biome]
comment: There has been some concern raised (see Issue #143) about the usefulness of the assertion that organisms have evolved within a given biome. They may have evolved adaptations elsewhere and demonstrating one or the other is often not feasible. Consider relabelling to "environmental system determined by an ecological community" or similar.

comment: Ocean biomes are determined by major bodies of saline water, principal components of the hydrosphere. Approximately 71% of the Earth's surface is covered by ocean, a continuous body of water that is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller seas. More than half of this area is over 3,000 metres (9,800 ft) deep. Average oceanic salinity is around 35 parts per thousand (ppt) (3.5%), and nearly all seawater has a salinity in the range of 30 to 38 ppt.

comment: This class aligns to the Coastal and Marine Ecological Classification Standard (CMECS). In ENVO, we may adapt the definition for consistency, but the semantics (meaning) of the term should be unaffected. Please consult the CMECS catalogue (https://cmecscatalog.org/) for authoritative and semantically unconstrained definitions. CMECS provides the following notes: "Commonly found on intertidal mud flats along the shores of estuaries. Tidal mangrove shrublands may include immature stands or stunted mature trees that indicate a harsh growing environment. Areas characterized by tall mangroves (> 6 meters) are placed in the Tidal Mangrove Forest Biotic Group. Where tidal amplitude is relatively low, the vegetation forms narrow bands along the coastal plains, and it rarely penetrates inland more than several kilometers along rivers. Where tidal amplitude is greater, mangroves extend further inland along river courses, forming extensive stands in the major river deltas. Also, mangrove cays may occur within the lagoon complex of barrier reefs. The list of biotic communities for this group is long: a few examples are provided below, and the complete list is available in Appendix F"

name: alpine tundra biome
def: "A tundra biome which exists at high altitudes and where vegetation - dominated by a few species of dwarf shrubs, a few grasses, sedges, lichens, and mosses - is stunted due to low temperatures and high winds." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_tundra]
comment: The absence of trees in this biome is primarily due to high altitude rather than high latitude. On Earth, it lies roughly between the summer isotherm of 10 degrees Centigrade and the snow line. Primary productivity is low in this biome because of the extremes of climate. {xref="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4808-4736"}
