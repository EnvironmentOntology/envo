ENVO:00000218	black smoker	ENVO:01000122	marine hydrothermal vent	active chimney|oceanic vent|sea vent		A hydrothermal vent found on the ocean floor. The vents are formed in fields hundreds of meters wide when superheated water from below the Earth's crust comes through the ocean floor. The superheated water is rich in dissolved minerals from the crust, most notably sulfides, which crystallize to create a chimney-like structure around each vent. When the superheated water in the vent comes in contact with the cold ocean water, many minerals are precipitated, creating the distinctive black color. The metal sulfides that are deposited can become massive sulfide ore deposits in time.

A spit is a type of bar or beach that develops where a re-entrant occurs, such as at a cove, bay, ria, or river mouth. Spits are formed by the movement of sediment (typically sand) along a shore by a process known as longshore drift. Where the direction of the shore turns inland (reenters) the longshore current spreads out or dissipates. No longer able to carry the full load, much of the sediment is dropped. This causes a bar to build out from the shore, eventually becoming a spit.

Glacial outwash is generated when sediment laden streams of meltwater flow away from the glacier and are deposited to form broad outwash plains called sandurs. When the ice blocks melt, holes are left in the sandur.
ENVO:00000312	sandur	ENVO:00000086	plain	outwash plain		The plain formed by the large amounts of silt and sediment, picked up as a glacier erodes the underlying rocks as it moves slowly downhill, and at the snout of the glacier, meltwater can carry this sediment away from the glacier and deposit it on a broad plain. The material in the outwash plain is often size-sorted by the water runoff of the melting glacier with the finest materials, like silt, being the most distantly re-deposited, whereas larger boulders are the closest to the original terminus of the glacier.

ENVO:00000369	brine pool	ENVO:01000617|ENVO:01001308	hydroform|lentic water body	marine brine pool	envoPolar	"MERGED DEFINITION:
TARGET DEFINITION: A large area of brine on the ocean basin near cold seep vents which release methane into the water. These pools are concentrations of water having an extremely high salinity as compared to the surrounding ocean, caused by the motion of large salt deposits through salt tectonics.
--------------------
SOURCE DEFINITION: Marine brine pools are large areas of brine on the ocean basin. These pools are bodies of water that have a salinity three to five times greater than the surrounding ocean. For deep-sea brine pools the source of the salt is the dissolution of large salt deposits through salt tectonics. The brine often contains high concentrations of methane, providing energy to chemosynthetic animals that live near the pool."

They form because changes of their eruptive characteristics or the location of multiple vents in an area. Stratovolcanoes may form complex volcanoes, because they may overlap another from explosive eruptions, lava flows, pyroclastic flows and by repeated eruptions, to make multiple summits and vents. Stratovolcanoes could also form a large caldera that gets filled in by multiple small cinder cones, lava domes and craters may also develop on the caldera's rim.

ENVO:00000398	volcanic cone	ENVO:00000094|ENVO:00000176	elevated landform|volcanic feature	cone|cone|cone (geological)|lava cone		Built by fragments (called ejecta) thrown up (ejected) from a volcanic vent, piling up around the vent in the shape of a cone with a central crater.
ENVO:00000399	ash cone	ENVO:00000398	volcanic cone			A cone that is composed of particles of silt to sand size. Explosive eruptions from a vent where the magma is interacting with groundwater or the sea (as in an eruption off the coast) produce steam and are called phreatic. The interaction between the magma, expanding steam, and volcanic gases results in the ejection of mostly small particles called ash. Fallen ash has the consistency of flour. The unconsolidated ash forms an ash cone which becomes a tuff cone or tuff ring once the ash consolidates.
ENVO:00000400	cinder cone	ENVO:00000398	volcanic cone	mount		A cone built almost entirely of loose volcanic fragments called cinders (pumice, pyroclastics, or tephra). They are built from particles and blobs of congealed lava ejected from a single vent. As the gas-charged lava is blown violently into the air, it breaks into small fragments that solidify and fall as cinders around the vent to form a circular or oval cone. Most cinder cones have a bowl-shaped crater at the summit.
ENVO:00000401	spatter cone	ENVO:00000398	volcanic cone			A volcanic cone formed of molten lava ejected from a vent somewhat like taffy. Expanding gases in the lava fountains tear the liquid rock into irregular gobs that fall back to earth, forming a heap around the vent. The still partly liquid rock splashed down and over the sides of the developing mound is called spatter. Because spatter is not fully solid when it lands, the individual deposits are very irregular in shape and weld together as they cool, and in this way particularly differ from cinder and ash.
ENVO:00000402	mud volcano	ENVO:00000247	volcano			A volcano created by geologically excreted liquids and gases, although there are several different processes which may cause such activity. Temperatures are much cooler than igneous processes.

ENVO:00000404	stratovolcano	ENVO:00000247	volcano	composite volcano		A tall, conical volcano composed of many layers of hardened lava, tephra, and volcanic ash. These volcanoes are characterized by a steep profile and periodic, explosive eruptions. The lava that flows from them is viscous, and cools and hardens before spreading very far. The source magma of this rock is classified as acidic, or high in silica to intermediate (rhyolite, dacite, or andesite).
ENVO:00000406	mid-ocean ridge	ENVO:00000550	range of seamounts	OceanRidge		An underwater mountain range, formed by plate tectonics. This uplifting of the ocean floor occurs when convection currents rise in the mantle beneath the oceanic crust and create magma where two tectonic plates meet at a divergent boundary. The mid-ocean ridges of the world are connected and form a single global mid-oceanic ridge system that is part of every ocean.
ENVO:00000407	subglacial volcano	ENVO:00000247	volcano	tuya		A volcano produced by subglacial eruptions or eruptions beneath the surface of a lake melted into a glacier or ice mass by the rising lava.
ENVO:00000408	volcanic fissure	ENVO:00000247	volcano	fissure|fissure vent		A linear volcanic vent through which lava erupts, usually without any explosive activity. The vent is usually a few meters wide and may be many kilometers long. Fissure vents can cause large flood basalts and hannels. The volcano can usually be seen as a crack in the ground or on the ocean floor. Narrow fissures can be filled in with lava that hardens.

ENVO:00000420	tombolo	ENVO:00000167	bar	bar|island		A deposition landform such as a spit or bar which forms a narrow piece of land between an island or offshore rock and a mainland shore, or between two islands or offshore rocks. They usually form because the island causes wave refraction, depositing sand and shingle moved by longshore drift in each direction around the island where the waves meet. Eustatic sea level rise may also contribute to accretion as material is pushed up with rising sea levels.
ENVO:00000421	wave-cut platform	ENVO:01001884	surface landform	marine terrace		The narrow flat area often seen at the base of a sea cliff caused by the action of the waves.

ENVO:00000452	ribbon lake	ENVO:00000020	lake			A lake that is long, narrow, and finger-shaped, usually found in a glacial trough. Its formation begins when a glacier moves over an area containing alternate bands of hard and soft bedrock. The sharp-edged boulders carried at the bottom of the glacier erode the softer rock more quickly by abrasion, thus creating a hollow called a rock basin. On either side of the rock basin, the more resistant rock is eroded less and these outcrops of harder rock are known as rock bars, which act as dams between which rainwater may accumulate after the retreat of the ice age, filling up the rock basin and creating a ribbon lake. A ribbon lake may also form behind a terminal or recessional moraine, both of which also act as dams, enabling water to accumulate behind them. A ribbon lake may also occur if a tributary glacier joins a main glacier. The increase in power can create a trough, which is filled with water from a river/meltwater to create a ribbon lake.
ENVO:00000453	liman	ENVO:01000617	lentic water body			A lake or estuary that is formed at the mouth of a river where flow is blocked by a bar of sediments.

ENVO:00000460	penplain	ENVO:00000086	plain			A region of low topographic relief as a consequence of erosion by streams.
ENVO:00000461	pseudocrater	ENVO:00000514	crater	rootless vent		A volcanic landform which resembles a true volcanic crater, but differs in that it is not an actual vent from which lava has erupted. A pseudocrater is characterised by the absence of any magma conduit which connects below the surface of the earth. Pseudocraters are formed by steam explosions as flowing hot lava crosses over a wet surface, such as a swamp, a lake, or a pond. The explosive gases break through the lava surface in a manner similar to a phreatic eruption, and the tephra builds up crater-like forms which can appear very similar to real volcanic craters.
ENVO:00000462	polygenetic volcanic field	ENVO:00000354	volcanic field			A volcanic field of scattered volcanic vents. These volcanic fields, containing numerous polygenetic volcanoes, are noted for having more than one eruptive event from the same vent(s), rather than the more common monogenetic volcanic field. Polygenetic volcanic fields generally occur where there is a high-level magma chamber. These volcanic fields may show lithological discontinuities due to major changes in magma chemistry, volcanotectonic events, or long erosional intervals, and may last >10 million year period.

ENVO:00000491	subsequent stream	ENVO:00000023	stream			A stream whose course has been determined by selective headward erosion along weak strata. These streams have generally developed after the original stream. Subsequent streams developed independently of the original relief of the land and generally follow paths determined by the weak rock belts.
ENVO:00000492	resequent stream	ENVO:00000023	stream			A stream whose course follows the original relief, but at a lower level than the original slope (e.g., flows down a course determined by the underlying strata in the same direction). These streams develop later and are generally a tributary to a subsequent stream.
ENVO:00000493	obsequent stream	ENVO:00000023	stream	watercourse		A stream flowing in the opposite direction of the consequent drainage.
ENVO:00000494	insequent stream	ENVO:00000023	stream			A stream that has an almost random drainage often forming dendritic patterns.

Its thickness is usually much smaller than its other two dimensions. Thickness can vary from sub-centimeter scale to many meters in thickness and the lateral dimensions can extend over many kilometers. A dike is an intrusion into a cross-cutting fissure, meaning a dike cuts across other pre-existing layers or bodies of rock, this means that a dike is always younger than the rocks that contain it. Dikes are usually high angle to near vertical in orientation, but subsequent tectonic deformation may rotate the sequence of strata through which the dike lies so that the latter becomes horizontal.
ENVO:00000499	trough	ENVO:00000309	depressed landform	swale		A linear structural depression that extends laterally over a distance, while being less steep than a trench. A trough can be a narrow basin or a geologic rift. There are various oceanic troughs, troughs found under oceans; examples include the rift along the mid-oceanic ridge and the Cayman Trough.

ENVO:01000005	upwelling	ENVO:00000147	ocean current	marine upwelling		"MERGED DEFINITION:
TARGET DEFINITION: An oceanographic feature that involves wind-driven motion of dense, cooler, and usually nutrient-rich water towards the ocean surface, replacing the warmer, usually nutrient-deplete surface water.
--------------------
SOURCE DEFINITION: A marine upwelling is a net flow of marine water to the surface of the water column from deeper regions. This is often a result of surface water displacement off continental coasts by wind action. Localised upwellings may also occur along divergent fronts around eddies and along some of the major oceanographic features. Deeper waters often have higher nutrient content; consequently blooms of primary producers, such as planktonic algae, are generally observed around upwelling zones."
ENVO:01000006	coastal upwelling	ENVO:01000005	upwelling			An upwelling that is near a coast.
ENVO:01000057	marine algal bloom	ENVO:2000004	algal bloom	red tide	envoPolar	A marine algal bloom is a rapid increase or accumulation in the population of algae in a marine system. Typically, only one or a small number of phytoplankton  species are involved. Although there is no officially recognized threshold level, algae can be considered to be blooming at concentrations of hundreds to thousands of cells per milliliter, depending on the severity.
ENVO:01000058	kelp forest	ENVO:00000104	undersea feature	kelp bed		Kelp forests are underwater areas with a high density of kelp. They are recognized as one of the most productive and dynamic ecosystems on Earth. Smaller areas of anchored kelp are called kelp beds.
ENVO:01000062	marine benthic storm	ENVO:01000067	marine current			Benthic storms are strong benthic (near bottom) currents transporting sediment, created by the input of energy (largely kinetic) to the seabed. In regions with high mesoscale eddy activity, benthic storms are frequent and can create isohaline and isothermal conditions extending as much as 1000m above the seafloor.
ENVO:01000064	marine downwelling	ENVO:01000067	marine current			A marine downwelling describes a net current of marine surface water towards deeper regions of the water column. Marine downwellings are usually caused by differences in the density (and hence, temperature and salinity) of seawater.
ENVO:01000065	marine oxygen minimum zone	ENVO:01000686|ENVO:01001308	hydroform|marine water mass		envoPolar	A marine water mass which is characterized by having much lower than normal dissolved oxygen concentrations persistently.
ENVO:01000067	marine current	ENVO:01001607	water current		envoPolar	A water current which is maintained by a continuous, directed movement of marine water, generated by forces caused by breaking waves, wind, Coriolis force, temperature and salinity differences, and tides caused by the gravitational pull of astronomical bodies. Depth contours, shoreline configurations and interaction with other currents influence a current's direction and strength.
ENVO:01000068	marine streamer	ENVO:01000067	marine current			Marine streamers are tongues of cold water that extend > 100 km offshore from upwelling regions. Enhanced primary productivity may occur in these waters as they are typically more nutrient rich than marine surface waters.
ENVO:01000069	mesoscale marine eddy	ENVO:01000067	marine current			Mesoscale marine eddies are characterized by currents which flow in a roughly circular motion around the center of the eddy. The sense of rotation of these currents may either be cyclonic or anticyclonic. Ocean eddies are also usually made of water masses that are different to those outside of the eddy. Marine mesoscale eddies are between about 10 and 500 km in diameter, and persist for periods of days to months. They may be formed when an ocean current develops an instability. This instability grows, causing the current to meander, and eventually an eddy is pinched off from the meander.
ENVO:01000072	marine Taylor column	ENVO:01000299	Taylor column			A marine Taylor column is a Taylor column that is formed in a marine body of water. Currents flowing over shoaling topography such as seamounts are accelerated and destabilised, resulting in Taylor columns. Eddies and internal waves are generated downstream of the topological feature and may extend 1000 m or so above them. This may result in a localised increase in primary production where the Taylor column reaches surface waters.
ENVO:01000073	marine oligotrophic desert	ENVO:01000686	marine water mass			A marine water mass which is composed primarily of water with low concentrations of nutrients.
ENVO:01000074	oceanic gyre	ENVO:01000067	marine current			A gyre in oceanography is any large system of rotating ocean currents, particularly those involved with large wind movements. Gyres are caused by the Coriolis Effect; planetary vorticity  along with horizontal and vertical friction, which determine the circulation patterns from the wind curl (torque).
ENVO:01000098	deep ocean current	ENVO:01000067	marine current			A marine current that generally occurs below the permanent thermocline (where it occurs) or below 400 m depth and that is driven by density and temperature gradients.
ENVO:01000099	marine surface current	ENVO:01000067	marine current			A marine current bordered by the surface of the water column and the permanent thermocline, where it occurs. Surface currents are mostly wind driven and mostly limited to the top 400 m of the water column. Ocean currents are driven by the circulation of wind above surface waters. Frictional stress at the interface between the ocean and the wind causes the water to move in the direction of the wind. Large ocean currents are a response of the atmosphere and ocean to the flow of energy from the tropics to polar regions. In some cases, currents are transient features and affect only a small area. Other ocean currents are essentially permanent and extend over large horizontal distances.
ENVO:01000100	along-front current	ENVO:01000099	marine surface current			A marine surface current that flows along an oceanic front.

ENVO:01000257	white smoker	ENVO:01000122	marine hydrothermal vent			A hydrothermal vent found on the ocean floor which emits lighter-hued minerals, such as those containing barium, calcium and silicon. These alkaline hydrothermal vents also continuously generate acetyl thioesters, providing both the starting point for more complex organic molecules and the energy needed to produce them.
ENVO:01000262	seep	ENVO:00000027	spring			A seep is a spring in which water has filtered through permeable earth to the surface.
ENVO:01000263	cold seep	ENVO:01000262	seep	hydrocarbon seep|methane seep		"MERGED DEFINITION:
TARGET DEFINITION: A cold seep is a seep in which methane and other hydrocarbon-rich fluids rise to the sea floor.
--------------------
SOURCE DEFINITION: An area of the ocean floor where hydrogen sulfide, methane and other hydrocarbon-rich fluid seepage occurs. Cold seeps are distinct from hydrothermal vents: the former's emissions are of the same temperature as the surrounding seawater, whereas the latter's emissions are super-heated."
ENVO:01000265	hydrothermal seep	ENVO:01000262	seep	hot seep		A hydrothermal seep is a seep in which diffuse flow of geothermally heated fluids with high methane concentrations. This seep has been proposed as an intermediate between cold seeps and hydrothermal vents.

ENVO:01000285	holomictic lake	ENVO:00000020	lake	non-meromictic lake		A holomictic lake is a lake which mixes at least once per year. Mixing is caused by a uniform temperature distribution from the upper to lower layers of the lake.
ENVO:01000286	dimictic lake	ENVO:01000285	holomictic lake			"A dimitic lake is a holomictic lake which mixes from top to bottom during two mixing periods each year. Mixing typically occurs during the spring and autumn, when the lake is ""isothermal"" (i.e., at the same temperature from the top to the bottom). At this time the water throughout the lake is about 4°C, and, in the absence of any temperature or density differences, the lake readily mixes from top to bottom. These lakes are common in regions with temperate climates."
ENVO:01000287	polymictic lake	ENVO:01000285	holomictic lake			A polymictic lake is a holomictic lake which is too shallow to allow thermal stratification and which can mix from top to bottom through the ice-free period of the year.
