ENVO:00000292	watershed	ENVO:00000191	solid astronomical body part	RIDGE LINE|divide|divide|drainage basin|water divide		The separation between neighbouring drainage basins (catchments). In hilly country, the divide lies along topographical peaks and ridges, but in flat country or on a high plateau (especially where the ground is marshy) the divide may be invisible - just a more or less notional line on the ground on either side of which falling raindrops will start a journey to different rivers, and even to different sides of a country or continent.
ENVO:00000293	continental divide	ENVO:00000292	watershed			A watershed such that water falling on one side of the line eventually travels to one ocean or body of water, and water on the other side travels to another, generally on the opposite side of the continent.

ENVO:00000306	spit	ENVO:00000167	bar	bar|spit		A deposition landform found off coasts. A spit is a type of bar or beach that develops where a re-entrant occurs, such as at a cove, bay, ria, or river mouth. Spits are formed by the movement of sediment (typically sand) along a shore by a process known as longshore drift. Where the direction of the shore turns inland (reenters) the longshore current spreads out or dissipates. No longer able to carry the full load, much of the sediment is dropped. This causes a bar to build out from the shore, eventually becoming a spit.

Glacial outwash is generated when sediment laden streams of meltwater flow away from the glacier and are deposited to form broad outwash plains called sandurs. When the ice blocks melt, holes are left in the sandur.
ENVO:00000312	sandur	ENVO:00000086	plain	outwash plain		The plain formed by the large amounts of silt and sediment, picked up as a glacier erodes the underlying rocks as it moves slowly downhill, and at the snout of the glacier, meltwater can carry this sediment away from the glacier and deposit it on a broad plain. The material in the outwash plain is often size-sorted by the water runoff of the melting glacier with the finest materials, like silt, being the most distantly re-deposited, whereas larger boulders are the closest to the original terminus of the glacier.

ENVO:00000355	monogenetic volcanic field	ENVO:00000354	volcanic field			A volcanic field of small, scattered volcanic vents. These volcanic fields, containing numerous monogenetic volcanoes, are noted for having only one short eruptive event. Monogenetic fields occur only where the magma supply to the volcano is low or where vents are not close enough or large enough to develop plumbing systems for continuous feeding of magma.
ENVO:00000356	pyroclastic cone	ENVO:00000398	volcanic cone	pyroclastic dome		A cone made of material ejected from a volcano. The material can range from finest particles. In comparison, cinder cones are more uniform. They are usually found in or on larger features, such as stratovolcanoes, shield volcanoes and can be found inside calderas, however they can also be an independent feature. They can range from a few metres in height and are usually formed by a single eruption.
ENVO:00000357	lock	ENVO:00000010	transport feature			A device for raising and lowering boats between stretches of water of different levels on river and canal waterways. The distinguishing feature of a lock is a fixed chamber whose water level can be varied.

ENVO:00000369	brine pool	ENVO:01000617|ENVO:01001308	hydroform|lentic water body	marine brine pool	envoPolar	"MERGED DEFINITION:
TARGET DEFINITION: A large area of brine on the ocean basin near cold seep vents which release methane into the water. These pools are concentrations of water having an extremely high salinity as compared to the surrounding ocean, caused by the motion of large salt deposits through salt tectonics.
--------------------
SOURCE DEFINITION: Marine brine pools are large areas of brine on the ocean basin. These pools are bodies of water that have a salinity three to five times greater than the surrounding ocean. For deep-sea brine pools the source of the salt is the dissolution of large salt deposits through salt tectonics. The brine often contains high concentrations of methane, providing energy to chemosynthetic animals that live near the pool."
ENVO:00000370	tuya	ENVO:00000247	volcano			A distinctive, flat-topped, steep-sided volcano formed when lava erupts through a thick glacier or ice sheet.
ENVO:00000371	complex volcano	ENVO:00000247	volcano	compound volcano		A volcano with more than one feature. They form because changes of their eruptive characteristics or the location of multiple vents in an area. Stratovolcanoes may form complex volcanoes, because they may overlap another from explosive eruptions, lava flows, pyroclastic flows and by repeated eruptions, to make multiple summits and vents. Stratovolcanoes could also form a large caldera that gets filled in by multiple small cinder cones, lava domes and craters may also develop on the caldera's rim.
ENVO:00000372	pyroclastic shield volcano	ENVO:00000403	shield volcano	ignimbrite shield volcano|terrestrial ignimbrite shield		A shield volcano that is formed mostly of pyroclastic and highly explosive eruptions rather than relatively fluid basaltic lava issuing from vents or fissures on the surface of the volcano. They typically display low-angle flank slopes and have little or no central collapse, although a shallow sag in the shield is commonly observed. Lava is commonly extruded after the cessation of explosive activity commonly superposes the vent region.

ENVO:00000398	volcanic cone	ENVO:00000094|ENVO:00000176	elevated landform|volcanic feature	cone|cone|cone (geological)|lava cone		Built by fragments (called ejecta) thrown up (ejected) from a volcanic vent, piling up around the vent in the shape of a cone with a central crater.
ENVO:00000399	ash cone	ENVO:00000398	volcanic cone			A cone that is composed of particles of silt to sand size. Explosive eruptions from a vent where the magma is interacting with groundwater or the sea (as in an eruption off the coast) produce steam and are called phreatic. The interaction between the magma, expanding steam, and volcanic gases results in the ejection of mostly small particles called ash. Fallen ash has the consistency of flour. The unconsolidated ash forms an ash cone which becomes a tuff cone or tuff ring once the ash consolidates.
ENVO:00000400	cinder cone	ENVO:00000398	volcanic cone	mount		A cone built almost entirely of loose volcanic fragments called cinders (pumice, pyroclastics, or tephra). They are built from particles and blobs of congealed lava ejected from a single vent. As the gas-charged lava is blown violently into the air, it breaks into small fragments that solidify and fall as cinders around the vent to form a circular or oval cone. Most cinder cones have a bowl-shaped crater at the summit.
ENVO:00000401	spatter cone	ENVO:00000398	volcanic cone			A volcanic cone formed of molten lava ejected from a vent somewhat like taffy. Expanding gases in the lava fountains tear the liquid rock into irregular gobs that fall back to earth, forming a heap around the vent. The still partly liquid rock splashed down and over the sides of the developing mound is called spatter. Because spatter is not fully solid when it lands, the individual deposits are very irregular in shape and weld together as they cool, and in this way particularly differ from cinder and ash.
ENVO:00000402	mud volcano	ENVO:00000247	volcano			A volcano created by geologically excreted liquids and gases, although there are several different processes which may cause such activity. Temperatures are much cooler than igneous processes.
ENVO:00000403	shield volcano	ENVO:00000247	volcano	mount		A large volcano with shallowly-sloping sides.
ENVO:00000404	stratovolcano	ENVO:00000247	volcano	composite volcano		A tall, conical volcano composed of many layers of hardened lava, tephra, and volcanic ash. These volcanoes are characterized by a steep profile and periodic, explosive eruptions. The lava that flows from them is viscous, and cools and hardens before spreading very far. The source magma of this rock is classified as acidic, or high in silica to intermediate (rhyolite, dacite, or andesite).
ENVO:00000406	mid-ocean ridge	ENVO:00000550	range of seamounts	OceanRidge		An underwater mountain range, formed by plate tectonics. This uplifting of the ocean floor occurs when convection currents rise in the mantle beneath the oceanic crust and create magma where two tectonic plates meet at a divergent boundary. The mid-ocean ridges of the world are connected and form a single global mid-oceanic ridge system that is part of every ocean.
ENVO:00000407	subglacial volcano	ENVO:00000247	volcano	tuya		A volcano produced by subglacial eruptions or eruptions beneath the surface of a lake melted into a glacier or ice mass by the rising lava.
ENVO:00000408	volcanic fissure	ENVO:00000247	volcano	fissure|fissure vent		A linear volcanic vent through which lava erupts, usually without any explosive activity. The vent is usually a few meters wide and may be many kilometers long. Fissure vents can cause large flood basalts and hannels. The volcano can usually be seen as a crack in the ground or on the ocean floor. Narrow fissures can be filled in with lava that hardens.
ENVO:00000409	whirlpool	ENVO:01000067	marine current	WHRL|hydrographic feature		A large, swirling body of water produced by ocean tides.

When this happens valleys which were previously at sea level become submerged.
ENVO:00000419	stack	ENVO:00000176|ENVO:01001884	elevated landform|surface landform			A geological landform consisting of a steep and often vertical column or columns of rock in the sea near a coast.
ENVO:00000420	tombolo	ENVO:00000167	bar	bar|island		A deposition landform such as a spit or bar which forms a narrow piece of land between an island or offshore rock and a mainland shore, or between two islands or offshore rocks. They usually form because the island causes wave refraction, depositing sand and shingle moved by longshore drift in each direction around the island where the waves meet. Eustatic sea level rise may also contribute to accretion as material is pushed up with rising sea levels.
ENVO:00000421	wave-cut platform	ENVO:01001884	surface landform	marine terrace		The narrow flat area often seen at the base of a sea cliff caused by the action of the waves.

ENVO:00000452	ribbon lake	ENVO:00000020	lake			A lake that is long, narrow, and finger-shaped, usually found in a glacial trough. Its formation begins when a glacier moves over an area containing alternate bands of hard and soft bedrock. The sharp-edged boulders carried at the bottom of the glacier erode the softer rock more quickly by abrasion, thus creating a hollow called a rock basin. On either side of the rock basin, the more resistant rock is eroded less and these outcrops of harder rock are known as rock bars, which act as dams between which rainwater may accumulate after the retreat of the ice age, filling up the rock basin and creating a ribbon lake. A ribbon lake may also form behind a terminal or recessional moraine, both of which also act as dams, enabling water to accumulate behind them. A ribbon lake may also occur if a tributary glacier joins a main glacier. The increase in power can create a trough, which is filled with water from a river/meltwater to create a ribbon lake.

A pseudocrater is characterised by the absence of any magma conduit which connects below the surface of the earth. Pseudocraters are formed by steam explosions as flowing hot lava crosses over a wet surface, such as a swamp, a lake, or a pond. The explosive gases break through the lava surface in a manner similar to a phreatic eruption, and the tephra builds up crater-like forms which can appear very similar to real volcanic craters.

ENVO:01000005	upwelling	ENVO:00000147	ocean current	marine upwelling		"MERGED DEFINITION:
TARGET DEFINITION: An oceanographic feature that involves wind-driven motion of dense, cooler, and usually nutrient-rich water towards the ocean surface, replacing the warmer, usually nutrient-deplete surface water.
--------------------
SOURCE DEFINITION: A marine upwelling is a net flow of marine water to the surface of the water column from deeper regions. This is often a result of surface water displacement off continental coasts by wind action. Localised upwellings may also occur along divergent fronts around eddies and along some of the major oceanographic features. Deeper waters often have higher nutrient content; consequently blooms of primary producers, such as planktonic algae, are generally observed around upwelling zones."

It is dominated by halophytic (salt tolerant) herbaceous plants. The daily tidal surges bring in nutrients, which tend to settle in roots of the plants within the salt marsh. The natural chemical activity of salty (or brackish) water and the tendency of algae to bloom in the shallow unshaded water also allow for great biodiversity.

ENVO:01000066	marine anoxic zone	ENVO:01001201	marine environmental zone	dead zone	envoPolar	Marine anoxic zones are areas of marine water that are depleted of dissolved oxygen. This condition is generally found in areas that have restricted water exchange. In most cases, oxygen is prevented from reaching the deeper levels by a physical barrier (sill) as well as by a pronounced density stratification. Anoxic conditions will occur if the rate of oxidation of organic matter by bacteria is greater than the supply of dissolved oxygen.

ENVO:01000068	marine streamer	ENVO:01000067	marine current			Marine streamers are tongues of cold water that extend > 100 km offshore from upwelling regions. Enhanced primary productivity may occur in these waters as they are typically more nutrient rich than marine surface waters.
ENVO:01000069	mesoscale marine eddy	ENVO:01000067	marine current			Mesoscale marine eddies are characterized by currents which flow in a roughly circular motion around the center of the eddy. The sense of rotation of these currents may either be cyclonic or anticyclonic. Ocean eddies are also usually made of water masses that are different to those outside of the eddy. Marine mesoscale eddies are between about 10 and 500 km in diameter, and persist for periods of days to months. They may be formed when an ocean current develops an instability. This instability grows, causing the current to meander, and eventually an eddy is pinched off from the meander.
ENVO:01000072	marine Taylor column	ENVO:01000299	Taylor column			A marine Taylor column is a Taylor column that is formed in a marine body of water. Currents flowing over shoaling topography such as seamounts are accelerated and destabilised, resulting in Taylor columns.

ENVO:01000098	deep ocean current	ENVO:01000067	marine current			A marine current that generally occurs below the permanent thermocline (where it occurs) or below 400 m depth and that is driven by density and temperature gradients.
ENVO:01000099	marine surface current	ENVO:01000067	marine current			A marine current bordered by the surface of the water column and the permanent thermocline, where it occurs. Surface currents are mostly wind driven and mostly limited to the top 400 m of the water column. Ocean currents are driven by the circulation of wind above surface waters. Frictional stress at the interface between the ocean and the wind causes the water to move in the direction of the wind. Large ocean currents are a response of the atmosphere and ocean to the flow of energy from the tropics to polar regions. In some cases, currents are transient features and affect only a small area. Other ocean currents are essentially permanent and extend over large horizontal distances.
