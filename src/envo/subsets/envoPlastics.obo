def: "An accumulation of water of varying size." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_of_water]
comment: The term body of water most often refers to large accumulations of water, such as oceans, seas, and lakes, but it includes smaller pools of water such as ponds, wetlands, or more rarely, puddles. A body of water does not have to be still or contained; Rivers, streams, canals, and other geographical features where water moves from one place to another are also considered bodies of water.

comment: Everything under this parent must be a mass noun (i.e. not countable). All subclasses are to be understood as being composed primarily of the named entity, rather than restricted to that entity. For example, "ENVO:water" is to be understood as "environmental material composed primarly of some CHEBI:water".
comment: Instances of this class are portions of environmental materials, such as seawater in bucket, a water parcel in the photic zone of a lake, or the concrete that composes a building part. Instances of these portions may have fiat or non-fiat boundaries. For example, a water parcel has not physical boundaries, while the seawater in a bucket is bounded by the internal surfaces of the bucket.

comment: This class is distinct from a geometric surface, which is two-dimensional. The idea of "uppermost" may be problematic. Further, the definition of layer (the superclass of surface in rev 133) references surface. This may be another issue. Perhaps this can be made into an inferred class using 'bounding layer of' some material entity, note that 'bounding layer' implies containment, which may not be valid here.

comment: In ENVO's alignment with the Basic Formal Ontology, this class is being considered as a subclass of a proposed BFO class "system". The relation "environed_by" is also under development. Roughly, a system which includes a material entity (at least partially) within its site and causally influences that entity may be considered to environ it. Following the completion of this alignment, this class' definition and the definitions of its subclasses will be revised.

def: "A material part of an astronomical body." []
comment: Material parts of astronomical bodies generally have boundaries formed by discontinuities in qualities, composition, or other physical characterisitcs. These boundaries are sometimes sharp, and sometimes diffuse, with different classification systems and communities declaring varying thresholds (e.g. for where a shoreline, forest, or other entity begins and ends). However, some boundaries are declared by fiat - that is, by arbitrary human convention or decree - particularly by regulatory or other authorities and communities of practice. The classes in this hierarchy attempt to offer generalisable definitions that allow multiple classfiication systems to map to and interoperate through. If desired, we can create classes that declare thresholds used by a given authority or community under the more generic ones, annotated with source information.

comment: This classification is based on the thresholds detailed in GESAMP report # 99 on recommendation from the SDG 14 indicator team. While the definition is in accordance with the common use of this term (as per GESAMP report # 99), alternative size classifications exist. Alternative classifications are a piece of plastic which is between 1 and 5 millimetres in diameter, a piece of plastic which has a diameter less than 1 millimetre, or a piece of plastic which has a diameter greater than 330 micrometres. The use of the word diameter in this case was understood to mean the generalised form of diameter, i.e. the largest distance between two points belonging to an object. {xref="http://www.gesamp.org/publications/guidelines-for-the-monitoring-and-assessment-of-plastic-litter-in-the-ocean"}

comment: Materials which are usually assessed when appraising geodiversity include minerals, rocks, sediments, fossils, soils and water. Landforms factored into geodiversity metrics typically include folds, faults, and other expressions of morphology or relations between units of earth material. Natural processes that are included in measures of geodiversity are those which either maintain or change materials or geoforms, including tectonics, sediment transport, and pedogenesis. Geodiversity does not usually factor in anthropogenic entities. {xref=""}

comment: Prior to curing, thermoset materials often occur as a soft solid or viscous liquid prepolymer or resin. In the literature, those are often referred to thermosetting resins.\nDuring curing process, well-defined and irreversible chemical networks form in three dimensions thus giving the thermosets a strong and rigid structure that can be added to other materials to increase strength. {xref="https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-816808-0.00001-9"}
