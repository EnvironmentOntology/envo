comment: This was formerly represented as a water body, which would not be valid during dry periods. This class more properly refers to the container of the water body, thusfar always some depression, which periodically contains a water body.

comment: Everything under this parent must be a mass noun. All subclasses are to be understood as being composed primarily of the named entity, rather than restricted to that entity. For example, "ENVO:water" is to be understood as "environmental material composed primarly of some CHEBI:water". This class is currently being aligned to the Basic Formal Ontology. Following this alignment, its definition and the definitions of its subclasses will be revised.

namespace: ENVO
def: "A quality which inheres in a astronomical body or astronomical body part by virtue of the variation in its material composition, participation in geological processes, and the variation in is land- and hydroforms." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodiversity]
comment: Materials which are usually assessed when appraising geodiversity include minerals, rocks, sediments, fossils, soils and water. Landforms factored into geodiversity metrics typically include folds, faults, and other expressions of morphology or relations between units of earth material. Natural processes that are included in measures of geodiversity are those which either maintain or change materials or geoforms, including tectonics, sediment transport, and pedogenesis. Geodiversity does not usually factor in anthropogenic entities. {xref=""}
