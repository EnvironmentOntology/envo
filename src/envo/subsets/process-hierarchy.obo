External processes, such as solar-irradiance variations, variations of the Earth's orbital parameters (eccentricity, precession, and inclination), lithosphere motions, and volcanic activity, are factors in climatic variation. Internal variations of the climate system, e.g., changes in the abundance of greenhouse gases, also may produce fluctuations of sufficient magnitude and variability to explain observed climate change through the feedback processes interrelating the components of the climate system."

The event must be intense enough, occur in a large enough area, and persist for enough time to allow the formed particle population to be observed. There are no exact or universally agreed upon thresholds for the intensity, area and duration of such events. If elevated new particle formation rate is observed in the atmosphere (away from direct sources of the related gas-phase molecules) for an operationally defined period of time, practitioners often declare that such an event has taken place. {xref="https://github.com/EnvironmentOntology/envo/issues/602"}

comment: Note that the detection of such events, and thus the thresholds used to define them in the field, are operational and dependent on the technology and observation strategy used. The event must be intense enough, occur in a large enough area, and persist for enough time to allow the formed particle population to be observed. There are no exact or universally agreed upon thresholds for the intensity, area and duration of such events. If elevated new particle formation rate is observed in the atmosphere (away from direct sources of the related gas-phase molecules) for an operationally defined period of time, practitioners often declare that such an event has taken place. {xref="https://github.com/EnvironmentOntology/envo/issues/602"}

comment: This term is used both as a process and as an amount of mass added. Semantically speaking these are two distinct concepts (e.g., accumulation results in accumulation_amount of ice or snow gain), though accumulation_amount would more likely be an attribute.\n\nThe scope of this term varies depending on the definition.  Some definitions constrain themselves snow or ice added to glaciers; while others also include ice fields, snow cover, and/or floating ice.  How to resolve this depends on the scope desired.\n\nSome definitions include additional discussion of the the physics involved which would be useful for connecting glacier ontologies to atmospheric, hydrologic, etc. ontologies.  This information should be captured no matter how the inconsistencies above are resolved.

comment: Frost action in soils describes the processes of Frost Heave that occurs in the ground during the freezing period, and Thaw Weakening that occurs as the seasonally Frozen Ground thaws. Although it normally refers to seasonal freezing and thawing processes and effects, the term Frost action has also been used to describe the long-term heaving that occurs when soils are subjected continuously to a freezing temperature over a long period of time (years). Frost action contributes to the mechanical weathering (disintegration or breakdown) of soil and rock materials, by frost wedging, Cryoturbation activity, and to the development of cryotexture and cryogenic fabric in soils. {xref="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4808-4736"}

comment: The processes that form irregular structures in earth materials characterized by folded, broken and dislocated beds, and lenses of unconsolidated deposits, including organic horizons and even bedrock.  These processes include deep frost penetration, frost action, frost heaving, thaw settlement and all differential movements, including expansion and contraction due to temperature changes and the growth and disappearance of ground ice bodies, whether perennial or seasonal.  Low temperatures alone are not enough to produce cryoturbation; the water-ice phase change is necessary.  Cryoturbation is an important process in the development of patterned ground.

comment: There is no standard cut-off for the near-infrared range; therefore, the shortwave radiation range is also variously defined. It may be broadly defined to include all radiation with a wavelength of 0.1 micrometers and 5.0 micrometers or narrowly defined so as to include only radiation between 0.2 micrometers and 3.0 micrometers. {xref="Shortwave:radiation"}

def: "A fire which is planned and executed deliberately under human supervision." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_burn]
comment: Fire-stick farming was the practice of Indigenous Australians who regularly used fire to burn vegetation to facilitate hunting and to change the composition of plant and animal species in an area. Aboriginal people may have been able to aim the burning of the scrub to avoid growing areas. There may have been a ritual taboo against burning certain areas of jungle. This type of farming directly increased the food supply for Aboriginal people by promoting the growth of bush potatoes and other edible ground-level plants. {xref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire-stick_farming"}
comment: Planned burns are conducted for a variety of reasons such combating or preventing uncontrolled wildfires in order by reducing the fuel load in a wooded or similar areas with combustible vegetation. Alternatively planned burns, such as those practiced by various indigenous people, are conducted for a variety of reasons including facilitating agriculture, hunting and or traveling. As well as managing populations of parasitic species or game animals by decreasing or increasing the size of their habitats respectively. {xref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_American_use_of_fire_in_ecosystems#Reasons_for_and_Benefits_of_burning"}

name: microwave radiation
def: "A radiation process during which electromagnetic waves or their quanta are emitted at wavelengths and frequencies which travel exclusively in a line-of-sight fashion and which may produce molecular rotation and torsion on contact with matter." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave, https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso\:std\:iso\:21348]
comment: This definition focuses on the properties of microwaves rather than their wavelength or frequency limits. Considerable ambiguity exists around the wavelength and frequency thresholds of microwaves. The ISO 21348 definition bounds these waves at 1 mm and 15 mm, with frequencies between 100 GHz and 0.225 GHz.

comment: As with microwaves, considerable variation exists in the delimitation of frequency and wavelength thresholds for radiowaves. The ISO 21348 standard allows a wavelength range of 0.10 mm to 100 m and a frequency range of 300 GHz to 3 MHz. However, much lower thresholds also exist.
