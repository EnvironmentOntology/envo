External processes, such as solar-irradiance variations, variations of the Earth's orbital parameters (eccentricity, precession, and inclination), lithosphere motions, and volcanic activity, are factors in climatic variation. Internal variations of the climate system, e.g., changes in the abundance of greenhouse gases, also may produce fluctuations of sufficient magnitude and variability to explain observed climate change through the feedback processes interrelating the components of the climate system."

comment: A surface temperature inversion is usually required. In such an inversion, the surface must have a temperature below freezing, while the temperature of the atmosphere where the precipitation forms is above freezing. Alternately, if the temperature of the ground surface and glazed objects is typically near or below freezing (0C or 32F), it is necessary that the water drops be supercooled before striking. Freezing rain can sometimes occur on surfaces exposed to the air (such as tree limbs) with air temperatures slightly above freezing in strong winds. Local evaporational cooling may result in freezing. Freezing rain frequently occurs, therefore, as a transient condition between the occurrence of rain and ice pellets (sleet). When encountered by an aircraft in flight, freezing rain can cause a dangerous accretion of clear icing. In aviation weather observations, this hydrometeor is encoded ZR by NOAA. {xref="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4808-4736"}

comment: The U.S. National Weather Service specifies sustained wind or frequent gusts of 16 m per second (30 kt or 35 mi per hour) or greater, accompanied by falling and/or blowing snow, frequently reducing visibility to less than 400 m (0.25 mi or 0.4 km) for 3 hours or longer. Earlier definitions also included a condition of low temperatures, on the order of -7C (20F) or lower, or -12C (10F) or lower (severe blizzard). The name originated in the United States but it is also used in other countries. In the Antarctic the name is given to violent autumnal winds off the ice cap. In southeastern France, the cold north wind with snow is termed blizzard (see also boulbie). Similar storms in Russian Asia are the buran and purga. In popular usage in the United States and in England, the term is often used for any heavy snowstorm accompanied by strong winds.
comment: To qualify a snowstorm as a blizzard, some sources require the windspeed to be at least 56 km/h and the duration of the storm to be at least three hours. We set no such hard boundaries in this definition, as this should be done with reference to local standards. {comment="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blizzard"}

comment: In 1988, the FAO introduced a definition of aquaculture which reduces its confusion with capture fisheries: Aquaculture is the farming of aquatic organisms, including fish, molluscs, crustaceans and aquatic plants. Farming implies some form of intervention in the rearing process to enhance production, such as regular stocking, feeding, protection from predators, etc. Farming also implies individual or corporate ownership of the stock being cultivated. For statistical purposes, aquatic organisms which are harvested by an individual or corporate body which has owned them throughout their rearing period contribute to aquaculture, while aquatic organisms which are exploitable by the public as a common property resources, with or without appropriate licences, are the harvest of fisheries.

It can be difficult to determine how much a site has been anthropized in the case of urbanization because one must be able to estimate the state of the landscape before significant human action. {xref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropization"}

comment: This term is used both as a process and as an amount of mass added. Semantically speaking these are two distinct concepts (e.g., accumulation results in accumulation_amount of ice or snow gain), though accumulation_amount would more likely be an attribute.\n\nThe scope of this term varies depending on the definition.  Some definitions constrain themselves snow or ice added to glaciers; while others also include ice fields, snow cover, and/or floating ice.  How to resolve this depends on the scope desired.\n\nSome definitions include additional discussion of the the physics involved which would be useful for connecting glacier ontologies to atmospheric, hydrologic, etc. ontologies.  This information should be captured no matter how the inconsistencies above are resolved.

comment: Frost action in soils describes the processes of Frost Heave that occurs in the ground during the freezing period, and Thaw Weakening that occurs as the seasonally Frozen Ground thaws. Although it normally refers to seasonal freezing and thawing processes and effects, the term Frost action has also been used to describe the long-term heaving that occurs when soils are subjected continuously to a freezing temperature over a long period of time (years). Frost action contributes to the mechanical weathering (disintegration or breakdown) of soil and rock materials, by frost wedging, Cryoturbation activity, and to the development of cryotexture and cryogenic fabric in soils. {xref="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4808-4736"}

comment: The processes that form irregular structures in earth materials characterized by folded, broken and dislocated beds, and lenses of unconsolidated deposits, including organic horizons and even bedrock.  These processes include deep frost penetration, frost action, frost heaving, thaw settlement and all differential movements, including expansion and contraction due to temperature changes and the growth and disappearance of ground ice bodies, whether perennial or seasonal.  Low temperatures alone are not enough to produce cryoturbation; the water-ice phase change is necessary.  Cryoturbation is an important process in the development of patterned ground.

comment: Fire-stick farming was the practice of Indigenous Australians who regularly used fire to burn vegetation to facilitate hunting and to change the composition of plant and animal species in an area. Aboriginal people may have been able to aim the burning of the scrub to avoid growing areas. There may have been a ritual taboo against burning certain areas of jungle. This type of farming directly increased the food supply for Aboriginal people by promoting the growth of bush potatoes and other edible ground-level plants. {xref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire-stick_farming"}
comment: Planned burns are conducted for a variety of reasons such combating or preventing uncontrolled wildfires in order by reducing the fuel load in a wooded or similar areas with combustible vegetation. Alternatively planned burns, such as those practiced by various indigenous people, are conducted for a variety of reasons including facilitating agriculture, hunting and or traveling. As well as managing populations of parasitic species or game animals by decreasing or increasing the size of their habitats respectively. {xref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_American_use_of_fire_in_ecosystems#Reasons_for_and_Benefits_of_burning"}

comment: In nature, water-based precipitation will likely always have some liquid and solid/frozen components (especially in higher atmospheric layers) - sleet is generally composed of these phases in comparable proportions. Note that formation processes differ between sleet and other frozen precipitation. For example, hail, being larger in size than sleet or ice pellets, is formed by the accumulation of layers of freezing water in the clouds. Sleet, however, is formed due to temperature difference in the atmosphere {xref="https://sciencestruck.com/sleet-hail-what-is-difference"}

name: microwave radiation
def: "A radiation process during which electromagnetic waves or their quanta are emitted at wavelengths and frequencies which travel exclusively in a line-of-sight fashion and which may produce molecular rotation and torsion on contact with matter." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave, https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso\:std\:iso\:21348]
comment: This definition focuses on the properties of microwaves rather than their wavelength or frequency limits. Considerable ambiguity exists around the wavelength and frequency thresholds of microwaves. The ISO 21348 definition bounds these waves at 1 mm and 15 mm, with frequencies between 100 GHz and 0.225 GHz.

comment: As with microwaves, considerable variation exists in the delimitation of frequency and wavelength thresholds for radiowaves. The ISO 21348 standard allows a wavelength range of 0.10 mm to 100 m and a frequency range of 300 GHz to 3 MHz. However, much lower thresholds also exist.
