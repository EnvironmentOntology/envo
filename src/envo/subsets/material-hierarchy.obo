The exact definition of a mineral is under debate, especially with respect to the requirement a valid species be abiogenic, and to a lesser extent with regards to it having an ordered atomic structure.

def: "An environmental material which is primarily composed of minerals, varying proportions of sand, silt, and clay, organic material such as humus, interstitial gases, liquids, and a broad range of resident micro- and macroorganisms." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil]
comment: 'In engineering terms, soil is referred to as regolith, or loose rock material that lies above the 'solid geology'. Soil is commonly referred to as "earth" or "dirt"; technically, the term "dirt" should be restricted to displaced soil.' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil\n\n" The upper limit of soil is the boundary between soil and air, shallow water, live plants, or plant materials that have not begun to decompose. Areas are not considered to have soil if the surface is permanently covered by water too deep (typically more than 2.5 meters) for the growth of rooted plants.\n\nThe lower boundary that separates soil from the nonsoil underneath is most difficult to define. Soil consists of horizons near the Earth's surface that, in contrast to the underlying parent material, have been altered by the interactions of climate, relief, and living organisms over time. Commonly, soil grades at its lower boundary to hard rock or to earthy materials virtually devoid of animals, roots, or other marks of biological activity. For purposes of classification, the lower boundary of soil is arbitrarily set at 200 cm."

def: "Water ice which has formed by the freezing of sea water." []
comment: In the United States, NOAA sea ice operations does not include superstructure icing as being sea ice. In sea ice operations however, sea ice is any form of ice found at sea which has originated from the freezing of sea water. It presents the main kind of floating ice encountered at sea. Except where it forms ridges, sea ice is up to a few metres thick, in which respect it differs from shelf ice.  Sea ice may be discontinuous pieces (ice floes) moved on the ocean surface by wind and currents (pack ice), or a motionless sheet attached to the coast (land-fast ice). In brief, it forms first as lolly ice (frazil crystals), thickens into sludge, and coagulates into sheet ice, pancake ice, or into floes of various shapes and sizes. Thereafter, sea ice may develop into pack ice and/or become a form of pressure ice.  Sea ice less than one year old is called first-year ice. Perennial ice is sea ice that survives at least one summer. It may be subdivided into second-year ice and multi-year ice, where multiyear ice has survived at least two summers. {comment="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4808-4736"}

def: "Particulate environmental material which 1) is composed primarily of clay particles, with only minor proportions of other materials, 2) demonstrates plasticity when wet, and 3) is capable of hardening when dried or fired." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay]
comment: This definition is intentionally ambiguous to support the multiple thresholds set by different authorities.The distinction between silt and clay varies by discipline. Geologists and soil scientists usually consider the separation to occur at a particle size of 2 Î¼m (clays being finer than silts), sedimentologists often use 4â€“5 Î¼m, and colloid chemists use 1 Î¼m. Geotechnical engineers distinguish between silts and clays based on the plasticity properties of the soil, as measured by the soils' Atterberg limits. ISO 14688 grades clay particles as being smaller than 2 Î¼m and silt particles as being larger. Mixtures of sand, silt and less than 40% clay are called loam. Similar mixtures with greater than 40% clay are often considered clay soils. {xref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay"}

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_oil]
comment: Oils having a flash point of approximately 42 degrees Celsius and oils burned in cotton or wool-wick burners are not typically considered fuel oils.

comment: Common liming agents include calcium- and magnesium-rich materials in various forms, including marl, chalk, limestone, burnt lime or hydrated lime. Liming often improves plant growth and increases the activity of soil bacteria, but oversupply may result in harm to plant life.\nLiming can also improve aggregate stability on clay soils. For this purpose structure lime, products containing calcium oxide (CaO) or hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) in mixes with calcium carbonate (CaCO3), are often used. Structure liming can reduce losses of clay and nutrients from soil aggregates. {xref="Liming:(soil)"}

comment: Red soil typically derives from crystalline rock in warm, temperate, moist climates under deciduous or mixed forest. It has thin organic and organic-mineral layers, a black brown leached layer resting on an illuvium red layer. The majority of red soils have a loamy texture. Their chemical composition varies across regions, but often includes non-soluble material 90.47%, iron 3.61%, aluminium 2.92%, organic matter 1.01%, magnesium 0.70%, lime 0.56%, carbon dioxide 0.30%, potash 0.24%, soda 0.12%, phosphorus 0.09% and nitrogen 0.08%. \n\nOn the uplands, they are thin, poor and gravelly, sandy, or stony and porous, light-colored soils on which food crops like bajra can be grown. In contrast, on the lower plains and valleys they are rich, deep, dark colored fertile loam on which, under irrigation, can produce excellent crops like cotton, wheat, pulses, tobacco, jowar, linseed, millet, potatoes and fruits. {xref="Red:soil"}

def: "Particulate environmental material which is primarily composed of silt particles." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silt]
comment: This definition is intentionally ambiguous to support the multiple thresholds set by different authorities. Some authorities consider this soil material that contains 80% or more silt and less than 12% clay. In the Udden-Wentworth scale (due to Krumbein), silt particles range between 0.0039 to 0.0625 mm, larger than clay but smaller than sand particles. ISO 14688 grades silts between 0.002 mm and 0.063 mm. In actuality, silt is chemically distinct from clay, and unlike clay, grains of silt are approximately the same size in all dimensions; furthermore, their size ranges overlap. Clays are formed from thin plate-shaped particles held together by electrostatic forces, so present a cohesion. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture Soil Texture Classification system, the sand-silt distinction is made at the 0.05 mm particle size. The USDA system has been adopted by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). In the Unified Soil Classification System (USCS) and the AASHTO Soil Classification system, the sand-silt distinction is made at the 0.075 mm particle size (i.e., material passing the #200 sieve). Silts and clays are distinguished mechanically by their plasticity. {xref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silt", xref="https://sis.agr.gc.ca/cansis/glossary/t/index.html"}

def: "Ice which is formed from water." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice]
comment: Water ice can appear transparent or opaque bluish-white color, depending on the presence of impurities or air inclusions. The addition of other materials such as soil may further alter its appearance.\n\nWhen speaking about ice on Earth, usually water ice is meant - the solid, crystalline form of water found in the atmosphere as snow crystals, hail, ice pellets, etc., and on the earth's surface in forms such as hoarfrost, rime, glaze, sea ice, glacier ice, ground ice, frazil, anchor ice, etc.\n\nThis form of water is, strictly speaking, called ice Ih, the Roman numeral I distinguishing it from more than a dozen other phases and the letter h distinguishing it from the metastable cubic phase ice Ic. Ice Ih is the only one of the several known phases of water ice that is stable at commonly occurring temperatures and pressures. (Some of the other forms have very unusual properties, ice VII, for example, being stable only at pressures above 22 400 kg/cm^2, but then existing at temperatures up to about 100C.)\n\nIt has an open structure with a specific gravity of 0.9166 which is slightly less than water; because the water molecules bond to their neighbors covalently only in four directions; it therefore floats on higher density water, where broken molecular bonds permit closer packing. All commonly occurring forms of ice are crystalline, although large single crystals are relatively rare except in glaciers. The ice crystal lattice possesses hexagonal symmetry that manifests itself in the gross forms of such single crystals as are sometimes found in snow. At an air pressure of one atmosphere, ice melts at 0 C by definition of the Celsius temperature scale. (Strictly speaking the equilibrium point among water, ice, and vapor occurs at +0.01C, the triple point.) On the other hand, ice does not invariably form in liquid water cooled below this temperature; it has a tendency to supercool, more so in the absence of ice nuclei.\n\nIn permafrost regions, ice may occupy voids in soils and rocks and may develop in a variety of forms. Ice may be colourless to pale blue or greenish-blue. It may appear white due to included gas bubbles; in exposures, ground ice may also appear black.\n\nIn nature ice is formed either by: (a) the freezing of water, (b) the condensation of atmospheric water vapour direct into ice crystals, (c) the compaction of snow with or without the motion of a glacier, or (d) the impregnation of porous snow masses with water which subsequently freeze.

The powder has a particle size ranging from less than 3 micrometres to more than 1 millimetre, but typically 10 to 200 micrometres. The diatoms in each deposit contain different amounts of silica, depending on the age of the deposit. The species of diatom may differ among deposits. The species of diatom is dependent upon the age and paleo-environment of the deposit. In turn, the shape of a diatom is determined by its species. The typical chemical composition of oven-dried diatomaceous earth is 80 to 90% silica, with 2 to 4% alumina (attributed mostly to clay minerals) and 0.5 to 2% iron oxide. {comment="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatomaceous_earth#Geology_and_occurrence"}

comment: Typically 3 to 4 millimeters in diameter. These may form in both marine water and fresh water. They represent the first stages of sea ice growth; they merge under calm conditions to form thin sheets of ice on the surface (frazil ice), and consist of nearly pure fresh water. In fresh water, they form in supercooled water that is too turbulent to permit coagulation into sheet ice.  This is most common in swiftly flowing streams. They may accumulate as anchor ice on submerged objects obstructing the water flow. {xref="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4808-4736"}

comment: Depth hoar is associated with very fast crystal growth under large temperature gradients. Sometimes a layer of depth hoar forms just above, and may assist in identifying the summer surface. The low density and low strength of depth hoar can make it difficult to retrieve unbroken core sections during coring, and can complicate estimates of accumulation by microwave remote sensing. Layers of depth hoar also increase the likelihood of avalanching. This is one way in which firn formation may begin. Depth hoar is similar in physical origin to crevasse hoar.

def: "Water ice which 1) has a white or milky and opaque appearance, 2) has a granular texture, and 3) is formed as a result of the deposition and rapid freezing of supercooled water drops as they make contact with an exposed object." [https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4808-4736]
comment: Rime is denser and harder than hoarfrost, but lighter, softer, and less transparent than glaze. Rime is composed essentially of discrete ice granules and has densities as low as 0.2-0.3 g cm-3. Glaze is generally continuous but with some air pockets and has much higher densities. Factors that favor rime formation are small drop size, slow accretion, a high degree of supercooling, and rapid dissipation of latent heat of fusion. The opposite effects favor glaze formation. Both rime and glaze occur when supercooled water drops strike an object at a temperature below freezing. Such formation on terrestrial objects constitutes an ice storm; on aircraft, it is called aircraft icing (where rime is known as rime ice). Either rime or glaze may form on snow crystals, droxtals, or other ice particles in the atmosphere. When such a deposit is wholly or chiefly of rime, snow pellets result; when most or all of the deposit is glaze, ordinary hail or ice pellets result. The alternating clear and opaque layers of some hailstones represent glaze and rime, deposited under varying conditions around the growing hailstone. {xref="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4808-4736"}

comment: In British usage, a day on which the minimum temperature at the level of the ground or on the tops of low, close-growing vegetation falls to -0.9C (30.4F) or below (also called a "day with ground frost").  In more general usage, "frost" can refer to the condition that exists when the temperature of the Earth's surface and Earthbound objects fall below the melting point of water (0 degrees Celsius or 32 degrees Fahrenheit). Depending upon the actual values of ambient-air temperature, dewpoint, and the temperature attained by surface objects, frost may occur in a variety of forms. These include a general freeze, hoarfrost (or white frost), and dry freeze (or black frost). If a frost period is sufficiently severe to end the growing season (or delay its beginning), it is commonly referred to as a killing frost.

Undeformed first-year ice differs from older ice in that it is smoother and lacks refrozen melt ponds. Characteristically level where undisturbed by pressure, but where ridges occur, they  distinguished by being larger, more angular, and more porous than multiyear ridges. {xref="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4808-4736"}

name: ice fog
def: "Fog which is composed of particles of ice." [https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4808-4736]
comment: The suspended particles may be partly ice crystals 20 to 100 micron in diameter, but chiefly, especially when dense, droxtals 12-20 micron in diameter. Ice fog is formed by direct freezing of supercooled water droplets with little growth directly from the vapor. It occurs at very low temperatures, and usually in clear, calm weather in high latitudes. The sun is usually visible and may cause halo phenomena or luminous pillars. Ice fog is rare at temperatures warmer than -30 Â°C, and increases in frequency with decreasing temperature until it is almost always present at air temperatures of -45 Â°C in the vicinity of a source of water vapor. Such sources are the open water of fast-flowing streams or of the sea, herds of animals, volcanoes, and especially products of combustion for heating or propulsion. At temperatures warmer than -30 Â°C, these sources can cause steam fog of liquid water droplets, which may turn into ice fog when cooled. {xref="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4808-4736"}

comment: "While fermentation is also referred to in the production of brewed teas, this is inaccurate. Some herbal teas on the market today include probiotic cultures alongside tea leaves to maintain gut health but the tea itself hasn't been fermented. Most dried teas however don't use live cultures at all during production. Instead, harvested tea leaves undergo a natural chemical process known as oxidation, which also changes the color, flavor and level of health benefits in the resulting brew."

Plants in this genus are commonly referred to as yam bean, although the term \"yam bean\" can be another name for jÃ­cama.\n\nIn contrast to the root, the remainder of the jÃ­cama plant is very poisonous; the seeds contain the toxin rotenone, which is used to poison insects and fish.\n\nFAO: The yam bean is a legume but unlike its close relatives the soybean and other beans, the yam bean is cultivated for its large, tuberous roots."

Cake is often frosted with buttercream  or marzipan, and finished with piped borders and crystallized fruit." [Wikipedia:Cake]

def: "Food material which has been categorized by a characteristic such as granularity or temperature." []
comment: This term was renamed from "food product by quality" to align better with COB "characteristic" label, and as well to disambiguate from other use of "quality" as a food grading. This term is useful for tasks like food inspection where little prior knowledge of how the food came to be is available. Some terms like "food (frozen)" are both a quality descriptor and the output of a process.

comment: The definition of this is being discussed in issue: https://github.com/FoodOntology/foodon/issues/57\n\nNamely, how to characterize the threshold of ingredients that make for multi-component classification? Salt, pepper, spices wouldn't normally make a food multi-component?

It was first adopted by the 18th Session of the Codex Alimentarius Commission, (1989).\n\nThe Codex Classification includes food commodities and animal feedstuffs for which Codex maximum residue limits will not necessarily be established. The Classification is intended to be as complete a listing of food commodities in trade as possible, classified into groups on the basis of the commodity's similar potential for pesticide residues.\n\nThe Classification may also be appropriate for other purposes such as setting maximum levels for other types of residues or for other contaminants in food. The Codex Classification should be consulted in order to obtain a precise description of the food or animal feed commodities and, especially, in cases where Codex maximum residue limits have been set for groups of food and groups of animal feedstuffs. The Codex Classification is intended to promote harmonization of the terms used to describe commodities which are subject to maximum residue limits and of the approach to grouping commodities with similar potential for residue for which a common group maximum residue limit can be set."

def: "A physical-chemical component separated from the food source or its parts by extraction, centrifugation, filtration, heat processing, expressing or a similar process. The separated component may be converted through further processing. If this is done, the final substance is indexed. A water-extracted component may remain in aqueous dispersion. The extract, concentrate or isolate is indexed in preference to the anatomic part from which it is derived. For example, peanut oil is indexed under *PEANUT* combined wih *FAT OR OIL* rather than with *SEED OR KERNEL*. On the other hand, fruit and vegetable juices can be indexed under *FRUIT JUICE OR NECTAR* or *VEGETABLE JUICE* (A. PRODUCT TYPE); therefore the anatomic part of the plant should be indexed." []

comment: Examples are: water, apple juice, sherry, acidophilus milk, whipping cream and some heavy liqueurs. The range of low viscosity liquid spans sucrose solutions between 0 and 45% solids (viscosity range from 1 to 10 centipoise). Prefer 'solid pieces' factor term to 'small particles' if both appear in the food.
