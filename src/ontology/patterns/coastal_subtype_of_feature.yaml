  Pattern for classes representing a coast-specific subtype of an environmental feature

  Examples: [coastal water body](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_02000049), [coastal sea water](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00002150), [coastal upwelling](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000006) (3 total)

  TBD: given that coast has indeterminate boundaries, is adjacent to the correct relation here? Sometimes the text defs say "near".

classes: 
  environmental feature: "ENVO:03000042"
  sea coast: "ENVO:00000303"


relations: 
  adjacent to: "RO:0002220"


vars:
  feature: "'environmental feature'"

name:
  text: "coastal %s"
  vars:
    - feature

def:
  text: "An %s that is near a coast."
  vars:
    - feature

equivalentTo:
  text: "%s and ('adjacent to' some 'sea coast')"
  vars:
    - feature
