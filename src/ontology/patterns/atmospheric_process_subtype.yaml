description: >-

  A pattern for classes that represent the atmospheric subtype of a more general process,
  i.e. a specific subclass of that process that occurs in an atmosphere.

  Example: [atmospheric wind](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000793)

  Note that everything here should classify under [atmospheric process](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_02500003)

  environmental system process: ENVO:02500000
  atmosphere: ENVO:01000267
