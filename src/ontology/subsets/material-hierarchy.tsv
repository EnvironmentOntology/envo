Petroplinthite is a continuous, fractured or broken sheet of connected, strongly cemented to indurated nodules or mottles. Pisoliths are discrete strongly cemented to indurated nodules. Both petroplinthite and pisoliths develop from plinthite by hardening.

ENVO:00002253	umbrisol	ENVO:00001998	soil			Umbrisols are soils in which organic matter has accumulated within the mineral surface soil (in most cases with low base saturation) to the extent that it significantly affects the behaviour and utilization of the soil.
ENVO:00002254	vertisol	ENVO:00001998	soil			A soil in which there is a high content of expansive clay known as montmorillonite that forms deep cracks in drier seasons or years. Alternate shrinking and swelling causes self-mulching, where the soil material consistently mixes itself, causing vertisols to have an extremely deep A horizon and no B horizon.
ENVO:00002255	solonetz	ENVO:00001998	soil			Solonetz are soils with a dense, strongly structured, clayey subsurface horizon that has a high proportion of adsorbed Na and/or Mg ions. Solonetz that contain free soda (Na2CO3) are strongly alkaline (field pH > 8.5).
ENVO:00002256	regosol	ENVO:00001998	soil			Regosols form a taxonomic remnant group containing all soils that could not be accommodated in any of the other RSGs. In practice, Regosols are very weakly developed mineral soils in unconsolidated materials that do not have a mollic or umbric horizon, are not very shallow or very rich in gravels (Leptosols), sandy (Arenosols) or with fluvic materials (Fluvisols). Regosols are extensive in eroding lands, particularly in arid and semi-arid areas and in mountainous terrain.
