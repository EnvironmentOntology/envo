def: "An accumulation of water of varying size." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_of_water]
comment: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ The term body of water most often refers to large accumulations of water, such as oceans, seas, and lakes, but it includes smaller pools of water such as ponds, wetlands, or more rarely, puddles. A body of water does not have to be still or contained; Rivers, streams, canals, and other geographical features where water moves from one place to another are also considered bodies of water.

comment: There has been some concern raised (see Issue #143) about the usefulness of the assertion that organisms have evolved within a given biome. They may have evolved adaptations elsewhere and demonstrating one or the other is often not feasible. Consider relabelling to "environmental system determined by an ecological community" or similar.

def: "Soil is an environmental material which is primarily composed of minerals, varying proportions of sand, silt, and clay, organic material such as humus, gases, liquids, and a broad range of resident micro- and macroorganisms." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil]
comment: 'In engineering terms, soil is referred to as regolith, or loose rock material that lies above the 'solid geology'. Soil is commonly referred to as "earth" or "dirt"; technically, the term "dirt" should be restricted to displaced soil.' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil\n\n" The upper limit of soil is the boundary between soil and air, shallow water, live plants, or plant materials that have not begun to decompose. Areas are not considered to have soil if the surface is permanently covered by water too deep (typically more than 2.5 meters) for the growth of rooted plants.\n\nThe lower boundary that separates soil from the nonsoil underneath is most difficult to define. Soil consists of horizons near the Earth's surface that, in contrast to the underlying parent material, have been altered by the interactions of climate, relief, and living organisms over time. Commonly, soil grades at its lower boundary to hard rock or to earthy materials virtually devoid of animals, roots, or other marks of biological activity. For purposes of classification, the lower boundary of soil is arbitrarily set at 200 cm."

comment: This class is distinct from a geometric surface, which is two-dimensional. The idea of "uppermost" may be problematic. Further, the definition of layer (the superclass of surface in rev 133) references surface. This may be another issue. Perhaps this can be made into an inferred class using 'bounding layer of' some material entity, note that 'bounding layer' implies containment, which may not be valid here.

def: "Silt is granular material of a size somewhere between sand and clay whose mineral origin is quartz and feldspar." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silt]
comment: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ In the Udden-Wentworth scale (due to Krumbein), silt particles range between 0.0039 to 0.0625 mm, larger than clay but smaller than sand particles. ISO 14688 grades silts between 0.002 mm and 0.063 mm. In actuality, silt is chemically distinct from clay, and unlike clay, grains of silt are approximately the same size in all dimensions; furthermore, their size ranges overlap. Clays are formed from thin plate-shaped particles held together by electrostatic forces, so present a cohesion. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture Soil Texture Classification system, the sand-silt distinction is made at the 0.05 mm particle size. The USDA system has been adopted by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). In the Unified Soil Classification System (USCS) and the AASHTO Soil Classification system, the sand-silt distinction is made at the 0.075 mm particle size (i.e., material passing the #200 sieve). Silts and clays are distinguished mechanically by their plasticity.

comment: Frost action in soils describes the processes of Frost Heave that occurs in the ground during the freezing period, and Thaw Weakening that occurs as the seasonally Frozen Ground thaws. Although it normally refers to seasonal freezing and thawing processes and effects, the term Frost action has also been used to describe the long-term heaving that occurs when soils are subjected continuously to a freezing temperature over a long period of time (years). Frost action contributes to the mechanical weathering (disintegration or breakdown) of soil and rock materials, by frost wedging, Cryoturbation activity, and to the development of cryotexture and cryogenic fabric in soils. {xref="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4808-4736"}

comment: The processes that form irregular structures in earth materials characterized by folded, broken and dislocated beds, and lenses of unconsolidated deposits, including organic horizons and even bedrock.  These processes include deep frost penetration, frost action, frost heaving, thaw settlement and all differential movements, including expansion and contraction due to temperature changes and the growth and disappearance of ground ice bodies, whether perennial or seasonal.  Low temperatures alone are not enough to produce cryoturbation; the water-ice phase change is necessary.  Cryoturbation is an important process in the development of patterned ground.
