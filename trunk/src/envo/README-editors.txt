These notes are for the EDITORS of envo

== Preliminary ==

Make sure you are using Protege 4 or Protege 5

More docs will be added here later. For now, crib from:
https://github.com/Planteome/plant-trait-ontology/blob/master/README-editors.txt


=== Plugins ===

http://wiki.geneontology.org/index.php/Ontology_editor_plugins

== Editors Version ==

NOTE: we have switched to OWL as the edit version

The editors version is envo-edit.obo

** DO NOT EDIT envo.obo OR envo.owl **

envo.obo is the release version

== ID Ranges ==

These are stored in the file

  src/envo/envo-idranges.owl

** ONLY USE IDs WITHIN YOUR RANGE!! **

=== Setting ID ranges in OBO-Edit ===

 In the Metadata menu, select the ID manager option. You can set the ID range of any 
 profile you create here by clicking on the settings icon (cog wheels) next to the profile 
 name. In the window that appears, you can set the ID range by editing the default rule: 
 "ID:$sequence(<number of digits>,<minimum of range>,<maximum of range>)$"
 Thus, "ENVO:$sequence(8,2000000,2999999)$" will set a range of 8 digit IDs from 200000 
 to 2999999.
