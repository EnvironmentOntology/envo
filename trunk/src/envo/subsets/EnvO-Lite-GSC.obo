comment: Experimental relation used in EnvO. A condition defines a restricted range of a given quality or combination of qualities. If an environment class, E, has_condition C, then all qualities listed in C are restricted to the ranges defined in C in E. This is not intended as a logical conditional. Note that this relation is transitive.
