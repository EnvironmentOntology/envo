ENVO:01000018 : gravel   
OLD: Rock whose pieces are at least two millimeters (2mm) in its largest dimension (about 1/12 of an inch) and no more than 75 millimeters (about 3 inches).
NEW: Gravel is an environmental material which is composed of pieces of rock that are at least two millimeters (2mm) in its largest dimension and no more than 75 millimeters.


ENVO:01000020 : estuarine biome   
OLD: Expressions of the estuarine biome occur at wide lower courses of a rivers where they flows into a sea. Estuaries experience tidal flows and their water is a changing mixture of fresh and salt.

ENVO:01000181 : mangrove biome   
OLD: A mangrove biome is a terrestrial biome which includes, across its spatial extent, mangrove plants (Rhizophoraceae).
NEW: A mangrove biome is a terrestrial biome which includes, across its spatial extent, mangrove plants (Rhizophoraceae). Mangrove plants are able to withstand high levels of salinity as well as regions of anoxia and frequent tidal inundation. Mangrove biomes often occur near tropical and sub-tropical estuaries and depositional marine coastal environments where fine sediments (often with high organic content) collect in areas protected from high energy wave action.
